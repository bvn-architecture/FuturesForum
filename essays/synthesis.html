    <article class="essay">
    <p>In thinking about what an architectural office of the future may look like in 2030 I’ve first had a look back 15 years at the architectural office of the 90’s and how things have changed, from the skivvy, bow tie wearing days. When drawing boards still occupied at least half the office, digital cameras were the size of phone books, faxes where the standard form of communication and 3D Rendering was a bespoke highly expensive luxury.</p>
<p>Those days saw the emergence of technology in computers and software as the driving force behind how we produced architecture. In the intervening years that growth has accelerated with increasing speed. New ways of doing things enter our landscape, first as occasional methods and then becoming mainstream. Sketchup Rhino, Grasshopper are the evolution of AutoCAD and Microstation. At the time these were viewed with the same aura of eagerness and potential that each new software package presents today.</p>
<p>As architects we have always had the role of translating ideas into visual and hopefully built form. Increasingly as technology evolves we have been able to use this to develop the tools to lead the conversation. As the tools become more sophisticated they are then directly able to go from design to production. Already the use of 3d printers is becoming mainstream. A world where what we draw is directly connected to machines which not only manufacture components but assemble and construct them together is not far away.<br />
The speed of technology growth in the next 15 years will no doubt continue. As will our ability to communicate with clients at an ever increasing level of reality. As architects we should look to what opportunities this presents to reengage as thought leaders in the 2030 practice of the future.</p>
<p>In 2000 the role of the architect and their place within the how of building creation had become subjugated to project managers. Working under them as just another expendable consultant. As a profession we had let ourselves give up the ground as project leaders, developed over many decades, and let it pass onto others.<br />
In comparison to where we sit today and what opportunity this has for the architectural office of 2030, it would suggest that the tide has started to turn. Whilst it still the norm that buildings must be, on time, on budget and more often than not iconic; we are starting to see an appreciation of the role that architects can have. Not just in the role as a designer but as the motivator and thought protagonist leading to the generation of better ideas and solutions.</p>
<p>Increasingly this role is not in isolation, as in the past, but working together with others. The power of the collective is becoming increasingly apparent. In so doing we are creating an ability to blur the lines in what we do. In some ways our skills are akin to that of traditional heroes like Buckminster Fuller. In 1963 he described the role of the architect as a</p>
<blockquote><p>“Synthesis of artist, inventor, mechanic, objective economist and evolutionary strategist”</p></blockquote>
<p>The difference in the future will be the diversity of this role being seen in the development of skills as generalists. We would not necessarily be masters of each of these areas; dictating how things should occur. The architect of 2030 could be described as more akin to a professional conductor. They would have an appreciation of what different people bring to the table—and an ability to bring these together with their own. In this model the traditional line of responsibilities are blurred. There are opportunities for a number of voices at the table each contributing and participating in the final outcome.</p>
<p>This blurring of lines and responsibilities will lead to tremendous opportunity for the practice of the future. With the coming together of architects with other professions and roles. In this vision of a 2030 architectural studio, the space is one that houses many different people and provides the common infrastructure for their needs. Reception, tea spaces and meeting rooms are all shared. We have started to see this occur in some of our own work in BVN and worldwide at institutions like the HUB Westminster in London. There, within a single environment you have a multitude of professions. A night school, magazine headquarters, startup spaces, graphic designers, architects and environmental scientists; all sharing the same workplace. People within these spaces are not typically working on the same projects but they are finding that engaging with each other in the same space offers the opportunity to create a symbiotic transfer of ideas and knowledge. Each group building from the next to create the solution or generate the spark of an idea for their particular project.</p>

<p>To begin with it seemed as if this was another moan about how project management is eating our dinner. By the end I think it’s more optimistic.</p>
<p>At the risk of asking too many questions in this comment:<br />
* Do people think that overall project quality has diminished with the rise in importance of project managers?<br />
* Is that too simplistic a question?<br />
* Maybe projects have got better on a set of dimensions that matter to clients but not along dimensions that matter to architects?</p>
<p>It feels like the idea of this is that we reframe our offering to concentrate on what we do best. I like the analogy with a conductor. (Although I think others will hate it!) Taken to its ultimate conclusion it feels as if this fits well with the <a href="http://blogs.bvn.com.au/tropos/2015/02/15/fluid-tiling/" rel="nofollow">Fluid Tiling</a> essay. The conductor needn’t be able to play each instrument, just be able to make sure the the specific experts play well together.</p>
<p>I’d imagine that the idea of “letting go” of more areas of expertise will upset people, but it feels more like reframing what we do to exclude the bits we don’t want to do and include more of the bits that we do.</p>
<p>I’d be interested to hear what peoples’ thoughts on where that frame might lie!</p>

<p>I don’t think demonizing PM’s leads to a very happy life….<br />
In my experience, I’ve seen the good, the bad and the downright pathetic ends of the PM spectrum.<br />
The reality of most of what they do is stuff that we don’t want to do anyway eg take the minutes and yell at the underperforming consultants.<br />
I think that we need to stop thinking of them and our clients (who also come in good and bad variations!) as a problem.  We need to find more sophisticated ways of working with them – and along the way improving our own attitudes and biases and leading by example.  I’d love to see a future where PM’s and CM’s are co-collaborators with us.  For example, on Minters we have had a seriously fast track program, and with the help of the Construction Managers (who were engaged very early and at the same time as the Project Managers) we have been able to find ways to design and build things that without that cooperation and understanding between all the parties including our client would not have been possible.<br />
It all comes back to relationships.</p>
</li>					
<li><span class="commenter">Bill Dowzer</span>
				
<p>I tend to agree with Peter’s comments, not waging in on the PM debate, enough said there. I think there is a space to explore in the independent micro players collaborating as a way of practicing in the future. We are seeing the rise of the individual as a powerful position choosing projects rather than practices to be involved in. An interesting possibility is what future places can be designed to house these collectives and promote engagement.</p>
<p>Is the mid size practice (of which we probably are) destined to die? Do you need to be the one stop shop or the collective?</p>
</li>					
<li><span class="commenter">David McGirr</span>
				
<p>More questions about the PM thing rather than answers to Ben’s – </p>
<p>“As a profession we had let ourselves give up the ground as project leaders, developed over many decades, and let it pass onto others.”</p>
<p>That’s an astute observation, and I think the method of looking backward to look forward has merit but for it to be truly effective you would really need to explore in detail the historical context for why Architects supposedly abdicated this PM role in the late 20th Century in the first place*.<br />
This argument is always framed as ‘we dropped the ball as a profession’ which may be partly true, but it’s much more complex and interesting than that. Consider for instance the following 2 factors at play – </p>
<p>•	At the height of postmodernism, Architects specifically rejected the role of contract admin and similar ‘clerkitect’ aspects of the profession (rather have it ‘taken from them’) in favour of solving the ‘problem’ of the failed modernist project instead (which in the wake of many  failed building projects they saw being resolved by discussion, theory and ‘Paper Architecture’ in the first instance rather than in built form)<br />
•	After the end of World War 2 the established and highly organized military industrial complex needed to something else to do, and large scale building/rebuilding (which the War itself actually contributed toward the necessity for) was a natural fit for these highly skilled and newly unemployed professionals to take up. Its no coincidence that the first wave for professional PMs in the 50s and 60s were actually ex-army. There was no way the Architectural profession could compete in this space.</p>
<p>Imagining where we should be or want to be (conductor/co-collaborater, whatever) is fine, but I would like to know what similar forces/conditions (economic/geo-political etc) like those described above are at work currently that will ‘force our hand’ as a profession in deciding ‘what we do’</p>
<p>*Also worth acknowledging the many Archs who buck the trend and still deliver lump sum contracts and offer a full service (even on a large scale). what value are they offering to their clients that PMS aren’t?</p>
</li>					
<li><span class="commenter">Peter Titmuss</span>
				
<p>Agree – takes too much energy to continue fighting the PM/Architect war.</p>
<p>I don’t think the profession abdicated its role of ‘project leader’ (for which I suspect is interpreted as ‘project visionary’) as much as the idea of a heroic ‘project visionary’, for a host of reasons, became obsolete/ambiguous/polyvalent.. not one voice as much as the synthesis of many.</p>
<p>Interesting to understand whether this vision of the future brings the various  (now separate) players together as a single one-stop-shop conglomerate or calls for more specialisation – independent micro players who can collaborate with any other at a moment’s notice….
