<p>This collection of essays is the first time that we’ve had such a bold outpouring of un-censored ideas. It’s exciting to see that we have such a diverse set of takes on what the future will be like.</p>

<p>It surprised me to see such strong themes coming out. The big topics on everyone’s mind are <em>People</em>, <em>Communication</em> and <em>Technology</em>. There is also a clear, underlying concern about <em>relevance</em>. Will ‘we’ still exist? Are we replaceable? Almost everyone is optimistic in the end, but the emergence of the theme speaks volumes.</p>

<p>We see people as our greatest asset. The power that we generate by being a team is what gives us an edge. Technology is going to impact our lives in a huge way but our humanity and relationships is still going to be key. The way that technology enables us to communicate opens new opportunities. We can inhabit spaces in new ways, ways that put us closer to people who can make our lives better. By mixing skills from outside the traditional architectural realm to make better results.</p>

<p>The environment made a much smaller appearance than it might have done five years ago. This might be that we think that in fifteen years it will be a solved problem? Maybe we just don’t care anymore? It isn’t one of our most pressing concerns. (Unless those who care are off saving the planet and not writing essays!)</p>

<p>This collection shows us a range of possible futures. It’s up to us to decide what pieces to take from them. Then our task is to work out how to get there!</p>

<p>Like all natural resources, it is likely it will become scarcer in the future.</p>
<p>The practice of Architecture in the future should learn how to handle precious and scarce resources, including time. The Architecture Office of the Future should allow its staff more time to ponder and debate about the Architecture Office of the Future.</p>
<p>After all, self-reflection and self-awareness are amongst the most difficult qualities one can ever achieve, and they take Time. Understanding this means knowing a lot.</p>

                    <p>The future of our practice and craft begins now,</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of thou.</p>
<p>I’m not talking space ships, LED’s and special effects,</p>
<p>We’re looking at those issues concerning the global population, whom we really affect.</p>
<p>There have been many brilliant pieces of art and prose,</p>
<p>Held up as shining examples, completed by unknown those.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is the future I see,</p>
<p>Where practicing is not about a single project; or a star-chitect or three.</p>
<p>It is a big shock! I know! I know!</p>
<p>But think of it as a chance for us all to grow.</p>
<p>Some worry that in future with those in building we cannot compete;</p>
<p>Some fear our craft being shipped offshore &amp; becoming obsolete.</p>
<p>But; to those I say—never fear my friend,</p>
<p>You don’t get into this business simply to construct &amp; mend!</p>
<p>Thanks to a fruit, we can create and collaborate together or apart,</p>
<p>These new type of projects we will be delving into are not those where the client is the start.</p>
<p>People may work on guerrilla projects,</p>
<p>Using their skills to solve the issues that policy neglects.</p>
<p>Architecture becomes about the seed or idea,</p>
<p>A new way of thinking &amp; considering problems, and not just those in Eritrea!</p>
<p>Because really we didn’t start for the biz at all…</p>
<p>But because our minds are curious about things big and small.</p>
<p>Together with others outside our field,</p>
<p>We redesign our cities, economy &amp; future; the answers no longer concealed.</p>
<p>How you say? Well that is up to you!</p>
<p>I simply hope this little poem is causative; the discussion not perdue!</p>

                    <h2 class="title">An Architect…?</h2>
                    <p>To begin to define what this could be, one must reflect upon the factors which make an architectural office now.</p>
<p>So…what defines an office of architecture? The typical categorisation of an architectural practice focuses on the number of practising architects. The standard analysis also uses size, number of offices, global location etc… as factors. Statistics can be misleading as they do not take into account other variables. The amount of hours worked, social scene and employee satisfaction are all aspects ignored by this method of analysis. Including the skill base and specialist knowledge that certain practices grow to achieve. For the collaboration with other companies or practices that take place. For example an office may have 50 employees; who only work within a 100 mile radius, working 9-5 hours and projects specialised into purely one sector. Another company of equal size may have a few offices or collaborate on a global scale. The hours worked may vary significantly and the social scene may also be enhanced and supported by the company, carrying out various sector work.</p>
<p>So far few conclusions have been drawn about an accurate method of defining an architectural practice. However an idea of defining a practice by any physical factors leads to a misrepresentation of the actual office itself. The observation that the biggest architectural practice with the highest number of qualified architects is the best is just not true.</p>
<p>In this essay I will be exploring the position of the architect. The relationship between the person, their roles and the ‘archetypal architects’ office’. Also external factors that help shape a practice both physically and demographically. My conclusions will lead onto future considerations for an ‘office’ and how architects and designers could begin to think about the title ‘architect’ and the emphasis placed on the terminology we use.</p>
<p>An Architect…?</p>
<p>Google the word and you get about 232,000,000 results in 0.31 seconds. The description explaining the role and responsibility of an architect is dry being:</p>
<blockquote><p>“…a person who plans, designs, and oversees the construction of buildings. To practice architecture means to provide services in connection with the design and construction of buildings and the space within the site surrounding the buildings, that have as their principal purpose human occupancy or use.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The role of an architect used to be very different. The title held a position of respect and prestige. This has not been completely lost today, but the roles and responsibilities have ebbed and altered. There are now builders, structural engineers, electrical consultants, quantity surveyors, project managers etc. All terms to describe new roles taken by additional 3rd parties which used to come under the banner of ‘architect’.</p>
<p>The term architect is now also being adopted by various sectors outside the construction industry. You see ‘cloud architects, solutions architects, IT architects etc. All dealing with virtual platforms and software. Something you cannot physically hold in your hand. This raises the question: ‘is architecture purely about the physical?’ Might the film Inception have a point with their ‘dream architects’? Does the virtual world, with advances in technology, become more of an influencing factor in shaping the way we live, inhabit buildings and interact with the world around us?</p>
<p>I must note that I am taking nothing away from those who have done 7 or more years at university and in practices. To go through each stage and emerge fully qualified into the world of work is a great achievement. Well done and congratulations to all who have! To come into the industry and begin again at the bottom of the ladder is tough! It is however the best way to learn and gain a good understanding and knowledge of all aspects of the design process. Working up from small scale tasks to the full responsibility of job running and creation of the built form. Roles of an architect on a project can vary and may even be reduced to a consultant role offering technical advice, or site delivery rather than any form of design role. This leads onto another idea which will be explored later – which is that the term ‘designer’ may be more apt to future descriptions of an architect’s role.</p>
<p>Some traits appear to be required by an architect or lead designer that go beyond that of purely design and construction. For example; they must be a salesman, winning the client over to not only their scheme but convincing them that they are the right person for the job. A design can do so much but people buy people. A problem solver and critical thinker who has the knowledge to look for and find solutions to any problems or constraints that arise. Whether through the client during briefing stage, site constraints – programme delays for weather etc. – and construction constraints on site if the builder has neglected to place an order and now the chosen product is not available in the correct quantities. A team player as all the decisions made are formed from interactions and conversations with the rest of the design team. The designer has to be adaptable to change, but also focused enough not to lose sight of the end goal and design intent. An element of psychology with an understanding of people is also a useful characteristic especially during the briefing stage with the client, ensuring the right questions are asked leading to a greater understanding of the specific needs and requirements. Technical knowledge of construction, which builds over time can then be applied to tailor each design decision just enough to be bespoke for the client yet standard enough (panel sizes etc…) not to blow the construction budget and help with the ease of the build. The logic of a mathematician must sit side by side with that of an artist when working through a scheme from concept to completion, bound together by a strong passion and determination to satisfy the client (first and foremost), the design team and the various subcontractors involved! Phew!</p>
<p>…In theory, the office could be a lab, a studio, a classroom, a retreat etc. This is why the definition of an architect’s studio is difficult one! Physical analysis is too constrained, how can you measure and quantify the qualities mentioned above?</p>
<p>I’ve indicated how an office should not be defined. I should start to offer up some solutions or options for what the office could be. The social human aspect of the office, hours worked, size and speciality could be a few so let’s explore these now.</p>
<p>Observing the social aspect of a practice, and speaking from personal experience of work and life, it is the people that make a space or workplace. We spend more time awake at work, working or in the office during the week than we do anywhere else! The people around you and your working environment has a huge impact on your daily life. When you leave a place it is the people that you miss. People are the reason buildings are designed. Their happiness and satisfaction is paramount to the buildings success. The work-life balance is crucial; with employers understanding the designers who work for them and their needs. The flexibility of the demands of the job. The extracurricular activities, offering social activities or further learning opportunities to boost morale being of utmost importance for satisfaction and a productive workforce.</p>
<p>This analysis leads onto hours worked. Again this differs between people – the productivity level and working thresholds vary. To be able to account for this and still maintain a happy practice is the ultimate goal. Lessons learned from the past will definitely be a factor in the offices of the future.</p>
<p>A final definition from those proffered in the earlier paragraph was that of size. The size of a practice could indicate success in both a commercial achievement and also staff welfare and satisfaction of their workplace for the company. A good practice will grow, maintaining its appeal to the best in the business. There could come a point where the practice is too large. Staff members feeling lost and under-appreciated. This is where a management structure will keep it strong. You could be anywhere in the world but still feel part of something larger, bigger and connected.</p>
<p>External factors are extra variables which can affect any office. The location, economic developments and technology advancements are all components which plug into the daily life of a workplace. They affect not only how tasks are performed but also with who, and how many people can do it.</p>
<p>The effects of location are an obvious factor to think about. I won’t dwell long on this as it places too great an importance on the physical aspect of a practice. This commentary is focusing on an office, but does not believe it should be constrained by walls or location etc… As previously mentioned it is the people and quality of these which effect the office. If the workplace is in the middle of nowhere then less people would physically be able to get there but do they need to be physically present all the time? To define an architectural office physically misses out on the true essence of the studio.</p>
<p>Another global factor which does impact an office is the economy. Most of us lived through at least one recession. The effect it has on not only the work done but amount of employees that can be retained during the difficult times. An economic recession is like doomsday for the construction industry. The impact is felt for a lot longer than other businesses which are more adaptable than building trade. Although new and unique challenges are thrown up during this time; the loss of colleagues, morale dip, dramatic shift in product availability and prices all leads to unease. It is out of the control of any project manager, practice director or lead architect and to survive there must be adaptability. This adaptability will be required in a future office.</p>
<p>Finally technology is a tool which can allow a greater collaboration globally. It can increase efficiency and allow many more people to connect / work / design in ways that we considered unachievable before. The tools provided are useful; the computer literate will advance and adapt. Having the skill to harness this and learn the capabilities of the new processes will help enable a better more cohesive design flow. The emphasis on the architect could lessen – the role of the technical whizz kid could increase. It is crucial to be open minded and attempt to understand as much as possible. With a greater knowledge comes a greater understanding, not only of design time, design capabilities and production of information etc. Harnessing this can be another outlet for creativity as the developments of a building can be dramatically enhanced through the use of certain programs. We can create built forms that could only be concept or take years to design. An individual’s efficiency can also increase leaving more time for the concept creation time. Technology also allows multi-site locations for an office whilst still maintaining a feeling of connectivity for all staff members, social media, staff intranet etc. These morale boosting technologies allow a community feel for each member of the practice.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I believe that the role of an architect will change. (Purposefully not defining an architectural office by any physical constraints.) There are many other consultants already shaping and defining buildings. The building regulations and guidelines create extra constraints when constructing a space. Those constraints leave fewer areas of opportunity for freedom. I am not saying this is always a negative. The role of the architect becomes more like a designer day by day. In my own experience, interior architects and designers often get a lot more freedom than architects on daily tasks and projects. This presents the question of titles and role definition.</p>
<p>It is also important to remember that the lead on a project may not always be an architect. Depending on the type of construction contract this could be anyone. We are seeing more and more collaborative approaches to design. For example fashion designers constructing interior spaces. There has always been the cross over in architecture between buildings, furniture, lighting etc. Now the flow is starting to move the other way too. Again, thinking back to how an architectural office of the future will emerge, this will be influenced by the role of an ‘architect’.</p>
<p>The architectural office of the future may lose the term ‘architect’ altogether. Becoming more of a design hub or atelier. A collaboration consortium of various specialities in their chosen field! Each group would plug in where appropriate. Design processes and principles are similar across the spectrum of design.</p>

                    <h2 class="title">Artificial intelligence of architecture</h2>
                    <p>The ongoing growth of the architectural profession in line with the current direction of technology will drive the architecture office of the future toward an application based office. It is expected that by 2030 the future architecture office will be a knowledge-based profession, where the ability to work independent of time and place will be normal practice. By this, the industry will be exempt from direct influences of architects whereby design input is based around programmed knowledge. It is expected that the future architectural office will develop through application software that utilizes the existing knowledge-base of architects. The new architectural office will form off the back of downloadable applications. Architectural information, data gained from years of practice, will be fed into these applications at a programming level. These applications will act on artificial intelligence, delivering solutions to clients based on historical knowledge and learned outcomes. This will change the face of architecture and the architectural office through the development of a mobile office, held in the hand of users.</p>

<p>The development of architectural products as an algorithm of design will emulate decision making. These algorithms will be based on information programmed into systems to form defined outcomes. This programmed information, and reasoning of knowledge is the basis of AI and is the first step in AI for architecture. The formation of solutions to problems through knowledge-based programming for architecture, refers to the ability to assume outcomes based on assigned information.</p>

<blockquote class="pull">
  <p>When joining two walls, this historical data defines how one wall joins to the next. The user can select the walls and location, but Revit assumes the outcome.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In architectural documentation programs such as Revit, knowledge based methods are currently being used. As an example, wall joint algorithms. These rely on a set of rules defined by existing knowledge. This information has come from years of practice, and has been converted to a language that can be measured and written to code. When joining two walls, this historical data defines how one wall joins to the next. The user can select the walls and location, but Revit assumes the outcome. It is expected the architectural industry will use similar systems. This will slowly eliminate the need for clients to engage directly with architects, as the knowledge base of architects will be converted to data and fed into application software. As such, technological advancements make the project deliverables ‘better’ for client and consultants as more information is readily available.</p>

<p>We can draw parallels between how we work as architects and the direction AI has taken since the 1970’s. We rely on historical data, experiences, gained knowledge and client input to deliver solutions. As we do more and more of one type of project, we can rely less and less on specific client input. As design progresses in parallel with technology, we begin to develop a more rigorous and programmed approach to design.</p>

<blockquote class="pull">
  <p>That database is currently the architectural model.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The forward progression of architecture must be in parallel to industry standards. And in line with the technological development of industries other than architecture. BIM is reliant on information gathered and fed into a database. That database is currently the architectural model. Design methodologies can be built into application based software and fed into such a model. Providing further design methodology based on information gathered at early design stages.</p>

<p>The level and detail that is capable through BIM documentation methods must then be considered. The methods used to deliver solutions currently, have grounds for development into programmable language. Current methods have begun the transformation from pen on paper, to data in a computer. It is expected then, that the progression of architectural design as a solution will move toward mobile data and eliminate the need for direct interaction with architects.</p>

<blockquote class="pull">
  <p>Picture architecture in the same manner in which you build Lego, block by block.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Picture architecture in the same manner in which you build Lego, block by block. Each block has a set of rules that determines its location in relation other blocks. In the same way that each room, or space should have a set of parameters to drive its relationships. For example a bathroom is less likely to join a kitchen than it is to join a bedroom. This is even less likely to join a garage. Break it down further and define the specifics of space. If a bathroom, natural ventilation is required. If a bedroom, one wall must have a robe. So on and so forth. In this manner, values can be added to each room or space and fed back in to the knowledge-based engine. When a bedroom is selected, the program assumes a robe will be required, it will assume a percentage of airflow is needed, as well as lighting requirements. If there is an external wall, the program realises the robe must be on one of three other walls. The engine will then assign a solution to these rules. This is a learned process, and the more strength and trust that is given to the program, the more accurate it will become. It is expected that the ability to develop such algorithms will certainly change the face of architecture. Particularly the practice and office based systems that are in place today. It is likely that architects need to align ourselves with information technology as the reality is that architecture is now being driven by technology.</p>

<p>The growth of architecture over the past ten years can be compared to the 70’s technology boom. A massive overhaul and redefinition of the industry is due. In the same way Expert-systems changed the game with regard to AI, a similar change is prevalent in architecture currently. Architecture will fast become a product rather than a service, by converting architecture to algorithmic design and application based solutions. In providing a tool that the public that can use to design alone, architecture may continue to serve the community.</p>

<blockquote class="pull">
  <p>…systems will work to teach themselves</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Architects, have a large amount of stored knowledge. Made up of past projects, historical data, client needs and climate conditions. It is the need of architects to then rely on this information and develop new methods of design. With inexperienced clients, architects need to pass on an amount of architectural stored knowledge. This information begins to form patterns, and can be further broken down. The argument being, that if it is measurable then we should be able to code it. Design methodology can also be broken down and can be measured, based on historical data. Through application development, less human input will be required. Such systems will work to teach themselves, and rely less on direction from outside sources. Mimicking the AI development and knowledge-based programming that has been available since the 1970’s. And can be explained through ‘machine learning’ where algorithms that improve over time.</p>

<p>Applications that rely on historical data allows clients to design without the need of an architect. Not being dependant on time and place, and using knowledge-based software will define the new office. This will remove the architect, in the traditional sense. The architectural office would no longer exist and design decisions will be applied through historical examples stored in a database. The required outcomes can be fed into the program at the user end. With the decisions being made based on the stored historical data.</p>

<p>Through such programming of data, patterns emerge. Applications can be allowed access patterns later when the same or similar situations arises. These algorithms can be written in many ways, suited to any situation and with any desired outcome. This is not limited to technical data as spatial qualities can also be measured in this manner. As an example, quality of light, light penetration, ventilation, room size, room depth, height, texture, sound quality, and a raft of others are measurable design qualities. It can be argued that methods of design, or architectural ethos specific to individual architects may be lost. Though, it could be conceived that from Corbusier’s five points of new architecture, through to Tange’s Metabolist theories, all can be broken down and coded. This information when fed into applications, will allow users to design based on historical knowledge and data originally defined by architects without losing the quality of space developed through true architectural input. It could be considered then, that we are immortalising architects through a technological manner. Though the whole idea of replacing architects with a design application may not be the nicest thought, we are able to revalue architecture in a modern world and relay architectural design ethos to the technological generation.</p>

		I think that there are two ways of interpreting this. One is where the AI gets so good at designing buildings that humans aren’t needed. I’ll call it the “Skynet” option. I’m sure that this is coming but I’m even more sure that it won’t be in the next 15 years.

		The other option is a watered down version of Skynet. The help offered by the computer grows in effectiveness. Before long the helpfulness passes some kind of threshold. I’m not sure where that is, but maybe it’s as useful as a new grad.

		At that point where the computers get helpful something big will happen. I can imagine all kinds of things but I won’t go into it here. It will  make things a lot faster as we are able to make changes at a coarser level. We can move a wall and not only will the wall re-join to other walls, but the room layout will change. This happens now but only within narrow parameters; it will become much ‘smarter’.

		The risk that I foresee isn’t that this will take away our livelihoods or make us drones. The risk that concerns me is that luddites will prevent technology from freeing us from that which is merely drudgery.

	    On an evolutionary level I expect that we will become AI or symbionts. We already have people wearing cochlear implants or pacemakers. Society will begin wearing things like Google glass and, like the internet the uptake will be fast and widespread, will be a part of everyday life.

		The natural progression is to enhance ourselves. For now we are naked cyborgs, electronic virgins.

		Tomorrow we will be upgrading the architecture of our minds and making massive cognitive upheavals.

		How we mentally and psychologically grapple with this extra processing power will be an even bigger challenge.

	    Combine the two and imagine being able to design through thought. Imagining/building a space in your conscious thought, and having all the rules that have been developed and established over time through the AI process click into place and construct themselves in a virtual reality. Ready to be explored. Close your eyes and walk through the space, check the boxes and confirm this is what you want. Hit print and watch a bunch of robots build your imagined architecture.

		I wonder if General AI ‘Skynet, Kubricks ‘Hal’ option or even the less scary ‘Disembodied Specialist AI’ ie where machines can learn from and improve rudimentary tasks should be our focus. What I’m questioning more generally is – would a technological solution enable the AOOTF, or do we enable this through other mechanisms and drivers such as office culture that enables people assets, branding and leveraging off product hype and consumerism (do we sell product or service?), scientific type processes that enable unique solutions through research or an office that thrives and is driven by entrepreneurial relationships. I think that it would be a stretch to believe that our profession or the construction industry more generally could drive AI. I suggest that service based professions such as ours are at best reactionary to technology. Maybe? Or is there an opportunity that we could invest in writing script to remove rudimentary tasks. Has anyone raised the idea that the production of drawings is an archaic method? That is, build sophisticated 3D model and then reduce and communicate to 2D. In my view this will be seen as being as backwards and as defunt as tapes and CDs were.

		This is not to say that there are other offices out there that believe that AI and parametric, robotic and advanced digital logics will be the future in the realisation of built architecture. Gramazio and Kohler are a good example

                    <h2 id="the-problem-of-interface">THE PROBLEM OF INTERFACE</h2>

<p>Our hands are a wonderful tool for crafting and forming physical objects.</p>

<p>Unfortunately we cannot access their full potential when we design on a computer.</p>

<p>This essay seeks to question the way our body interacts with the design process. It imagines a future where the promise of the digital is no longer restrained by the mouse and keyboard. A future where our hands’ fine motor control and sense of touch can be used to mould, shape and craft a digitally designed artefact.</p>

<p>We rely on our brain to abstract and visualise good design when using a computer. We limit the full potential of our hands by using the mouse and keyboard. We use a terrible interface to control the most powerful man-made tool the brain has ever had access to. Wasting the capacity to use the embodied knowledge of our hands and body to provide highly complex mastery over a tool and medium.</p>

<p>We should be liberating ourselves in how we control the computer.</p>

<h2 id="crafting-the-workbench-of-the-future">CRAFTING THE WORKBENCH OF THE FUTURE</h2>

<p>How can we release digital models from the flatness of a screen and into three dimensional physical reality?</p>

<p>How can we use the muscle memory of our hands to form a digital representation of spatial and textural composition?</p>

<p>Could a device reduce abstraction in the design process and allow us to go directly to sculpting three dimensional architecture?</p>

<p>Rapid progress is being made in the development of equipment that allows the computer to track the human body. Our smart phones are equipped with sensitive motion sensors. It has become second nature to rotate our screens and to use touch control combinations. The Kinect, TrackIR and Leap Motion give us the ability to rapidly and precisely track the movements of our hands and bodies in a three dimensional space.</p>

<p>The tools that could allow us to sculpt digital geometry with our hands already exist. Why have these not yet superseded the mouse and keyboard as control interfaces? Maybe it is because we are creating a flattened representation of three dimensional geometry on a computer screen.</p>

<p>The missing ingredient is three dimensional representation of the digital artefact in space. There are technologies being developed to address this limitation. These include augmented reality, virtual reality and holographic projection. Holographic projection is an exciting option, it would allow a digitally designed model to explode out of the computer screen and occupy physical space. It would allow people to experience and view the design in a collaborative environment. Multiple designers could work on the same spatial representation of a product at the same time.</p>

<h2 id="an-element-of-haptic-feedback">AN ELEMENT OF HAPTIC FEEDBACK</h2>

<p>The big problem with a holographic projection is that it doesn’t feel physical. The sense of touch is lost. There is no opportunity for haptic feedback, users are unable to train their muscle memory and learn from the formation of the artefact.</p>

<p>A mechanical exoskeleton for the hands could enable this sensory feedback. Combined with sensors to detect our hands and fingers in space, the exoskeleton could exert varying degrees of resistance or vibration to create the illusion of physical presence. This would allow us to push, squeeze, prod, pinch, drag and rotate the holographic representation and sense it through touch as if it were real.</p>

<p>Although lacking the charm of old school craftsmanship, the combination of holographic projection coupled with a haptic feedback mechanism would enable us to craft a digital object with the realistic and natural movement of our hands.</p>

<h2 id="workshop-based-architectural-practice">WORKSHOP BASED ARCHITECTURAL PRACTICE</h2>

<p>This computational crafting workbench would allow us to throw out most of the desks and screens we use day to day.</p>

<p>In place of these, we could stand up and move around our workbench, using tools to drill, texture, polish and cut our digital artefacts. A structural armature would frame each workbench to support the exoskeleton, spatial sensors and holographic projectors. The space would more closely resemble a high-tech manufacturing facility or workshop than an open plan office.</p>

<p>Alternatively, the projection could come from a clothing item or headset that would allow us to walk around and develop our design anywhere we like. It would allow us to design on the bus, to sit in a quiet, dimly lit space to concentrate or to project the design into the centre of a communal space for public feedback.</p>

<p>Or perhaps we could all lie back on comfortable seats and wear something that looks like this:</p>

	I really like the idea of working with virtual materials, but while still using our whole bodies. There is a lot of work on embodied interfaces and it’s really interesting (<a href="http://www.autodeskresearch.com/publications" rel="nofollow">Autodesk research tape drawing</a>, Andrew Burrow’s tangible wiki, at least one episode of startrek). 

	There is also the idea that we can have ‘materials’ that don’t follow our regular physics. Daniel Piker talks about <a href="https://spacesymmetrystructure.wordpress.com/2011/05/18/pseudo-physical-materials/" rel="nofollow">pseudo-physical materials</a> and how they can augment our thinking. If we could mix tangible interfaces and magic substances we might be onto something!

	The idea of the ‘rig’ is pretty nicely explored in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ready-Player-One-Ernest-Cline-ebook/dp/B005CVWWJY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1424050389&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=ready+player+one" rel="nofollow">Ready Player One</a>. There are lots of new technologies (shape memory alloys etc.) that might mature in the next 15 years. It’s not far off being reality.

	Watching a group of people around a large model physical is really interesting. If that model could be manipulated by all members, and the context/perspective changed it might make the communication and coordination part of designing things thousands of times faster. “Just <em>show</em> me…”

	The thing that I think might be interesting is how we define new materials. How do we decide where to draw the line between abstraction and reality?

<li><span class="commenter">David McGirr</span>
	Its a provocative notion: Using technology to ameliorate a situation technology itself produced, analogous to  using climate engineering to overcome climate change (“science created the problem, but science will fix it”).<br />
The counter argument is of course that application of this technology will exacerbate the problem; drive the wedge further between what we make and how we make it (that’s my immediate instinctive reaction looking at the image provided, although instincts aren’t always to be trusted).<br />
Also I’d like to make a devils advocate plug for abstraction (abstraction being the obstacle represented by a flat computer screen overcome by VR/AR whatever): Abstraction isn’t always a bad thing, abstraction allows for particular focus on things (through reduction, simplification) in the creative process. For example where would be without the Cartesian abstraction of a building to floor plan and section (yeah yeah it probably created a lot of problems and bad design too but its  a major development in understanding form visually).

	It’s coming!

	I think the point of this is that the abstraction is also being designed. You aren’t forced to use a fixed set of abstractions. The user can change point of view or interaction mode at will.

	The main advantage that I see from something like this is that it enables the user’s fine motor skills. <a href="http://dougengelbart.org/" rel="nofollow">People have known from the start</a> that the mouse and keyboard are a sub-par interface. I think that your analogy of climate engineering is misleading. The interface problem isn’t one that needs to be ameliorated as it leaves no lasting change. Once we change interface there is an immediate improvement. (Excepting a small relearning phase.)

                    <h2 class="title">Dear Diary,</h2>
                    <p>I’m sitting near the edge of a cliff. There are no sounds of humanity except my own breathing and the sound of the tip of this pen sliding over the paper.</p>

<p>As a habitual urbanite the change in soundscape is taking some getting used to! It always does when I come away from the city for one of these. The previous generation would probably have called it a “digital detox”. Before that people have gone out into the world for all kinds of reasons; Thoreau, Walkabout, enlightenment, self-discovery. My motivation isn’t nearly so highbrow—every so often I like to get away on my own, just to see if my sanity can stand time without distractions. If I listen to the voices in my head are they saying anything good?</p>

<p>I’ve just come back from a trip to San Francisco. A big meeting with SpaceX about our role in their new off-world programme. Their asteroid mining programme has eaten most of the smaller asteroids in the asteroid belt. Everything under a kilometre in diameter has been turned them into raw materials. Their plan now is to hollow out the big ones and make them into habitats. Our experience in virtual-testing appeals to them. They want to be confident that things are going to work when they get people there.</p>

<blockquote class="pull">
  <p>For the first time since the recession things really are out of this world!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For the first time since the recession things really are out of this world! Things weren’t looking so promising not too long ago.</p>

<p>It’s been quite a ride. I’m not sure I completely understand how we got here. I guess that since I’m out here explicitly to think, if I try to summarise our recent history perhaps it’ll make a bit more sense.</p>

<p>In hindsight all the pieces were on the board, they were just waiting for the big move to be played. Some kind of catalyst that would allow them to react and release all their potential. The 2018 recession was that catalyst.</p>

<p>The invention of robust quantum computers caused the 2018 recession. Quantum computers are able to ‘know’ all the possible answers to a question. Scientists found a way to scale them up from theoretical toys to viable machines far sooner than anyone expected. This had two main effects.</p>

<p>Until then computer power was governed by Moore’s law (the prediction from 1965 that computers would get twice as powerful every 18 months). The familiar doubling stopped and suddenly jumped by a factor of over 1000. Skipping 20 years of progress in a matter of months.</p>

<p>The second effect was far more disruptive. The system of encryption that the entire global economy was based on stopped working. It was no more effective than a polite sign saying “keep out”! Overnight the banks shut all electronic channels. What had been started by opal and PayWave had, by 2018, evolved into a cashless society. Children paid for trinkets at school fetes with their… Wait, what did we call them back then? I guess we still called them ‘phones’. Although telephoning was already a tertiary function at best. Physical money was just for criminals, geriatrics and collectors.</p>

<p>This reliance on virtual money meant that stock markets stopped. Nobody could transact for even simple things like groceries. There just wasn’t enough cash in circulation to fall back onto.</p>

<p>The recession was short but brutal. It seemed as if the increasing speed of everything applied even to economic disruption and recovery. The big technology companies had contingency plans and kept working with the new processing power bounty. Everyone else was bartering for rice. In an incredibly short time they released a new class of specific AI. By the time many professions got back to work their industry was obsolete. Actuaries and many other respectable jobs went the way of blacksmiths, coopers and threshers. It was all the disruptive power of the industrial revolution condensed from half a century to a matter of months.</p>

<p>Architecture was in a pretty bad way after the turn. ‘Design’, as its adherents liked to think of it, had escaped the laser focus of the AIs’ attention, but a huge proportion of the traditional clients that they worked for had just ceased to exist. However the means by which buildings were procured <em>had</em> succumbed to AI manipulation. Some ex-Cisco people had hired a dozen dull, but pragmatic (and unemployed) architects to help them develop a system. By parsing huge numbers of digital planning applications the AI was able to put together a solution that ‘satisficed’ the clients. It couldn’t ever advance the state of the art, but it was able to copy and paste from existing work until things looked good enough.</p>

<blockquote class="pull">
  <p>Clients had a hard time making the case for an architect when they could get something “ok” for next to nothing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Clients had a hard time making the case for an architect when they could get something “ok” for next to nothing. The architects also missed the growth of NTRal builders. Nonhuman Trades Robots meant big changes in the way buildings were actually put together.</p>

<p>It wasn’t only disaster that sprang from the recession. The turmoil unleashed by so many businesses being unable to trade drove rents to zero. Landlords realised that they could either expend effort on kicking people out, or just hope that things would bounce back and they’d have readymade tenants.</p>

<p>Architects had traditionally been pretty good tenants so they got a good deal on their rent-free space. With no cash flow they offered a similar deal to their staff: Stay and work out what our future is in the hope of being a part of it, or go and do something else. It was a tough call for a lot of people. The pressures of feeding families and staying housed weighed heavily on everyone. Even given the constraints of reality a surprisingly large contingent stayed on. Something to do with their identity being so intermingled with their profession.</p>

<p>The first order of business was to make an explicit case for the value of employing architectural services. This was considered ‘self-evident’ during the time that the title had been protected by various royal charters. Once cut and paste buildings were covered by the same charters, merely being biological wasn’t convincing enough. The separation of ‘institute’ and ‘board’ in many countries really helped. The institutes serving as conduits for conversation about architects explicit value offering.</p>

  <p>The rise of virtual reality meant that people expected much more from their immersive environments … people were really <strong><em>in</em></strong> the adventure.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To make some income from our spatial skills we moved into computer game design. It turns out that many of their issues paralleled our own. The rise of virtual reality meant that people expected much more from their immersive environments. People weren’t satisfied with cereal boxes with textures pasted on anymore. Now people were really <em>in</em> the adventure. The magic of walking through the haunted house or enchanted forest needed to be as much of a draw as the monsters or puzzles. Traditional game design studios turned to us to craft their spaces in a more nuanced way.</p>

<p>When working with games developers we saw firsthand how useful it was to have a broadly skilled team. The first project we worked on was a murder mystery on a walking city. The graphic style was totally Archigram so we were all right at home. It wasn’t just nerds and architects though. Their way of working made sure that the team was generalist. There were writers who made all the storylines work seamlessly, psychologists who made sure that the experiences were amplified as much as possible by pulling our primal levers. They even had an antique dealer who made sure that our furniture specs weren’t anachronistic and that the cupboards were stocked with the right sorts of things.</p>

<p>We brought this diversification back with us. Now (in the present) we’ve got about 40% architects on our teams. Graphic designers, anthropologists, animators, business strategists, programmers, simulation specialists, the teams form around whatever we’re working on. I’m getting ahead of myself; giving the game away that everything turns out well in the end. Back to how we got here.</p>

<p>The legacy of Despicable Me was still going strong. One of its spin offs was a game where the goal was to direct minions to do things that contributed to an ultimate goal. I guess it was in the grand tradition of lemmings. It was an amazing success! People loved the sense of agency it gave them—being able to boss something around. The game’s open architecture welcomed user contributed content. One of the most important being new behaviours for the minions. Before long plugins were available to allow people to do ‘real’ things. Replicating the functionality of spreadsheets and eventually someone made an interface layer to Revit.</p>

<blockquote class="pull">
  <p>They could answer these sorts of questions in real time as the model reconfigured.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Wearing a VR mask and being a minion-master didn’t really change the way people did architectural design. What it did do was to change the team make up dramatically. All the AI that was developed for the cut and paste buildings got embedded in Revit. It was trivial to make sure that your detailing was compliant with all the specs. Buildings are now designed with an army of minions ready to do the godlike genius’s bidding. That left nothing to do for people who <em>were</em> those minions. Of course that’s not really what happens! So much of ‘the old ways’ was coordination and documentation. Minion-cad allowed all the people who mattered to get together in a virtual world. They could experiment with the design; making bold moves with the wave of a hand. “What if we tried it with louvers all down the facade? How about just half as many?” They could answer these sorts of questions in real time as the model reconfigured. Now we design buildings over roughly the same timeframe but the process is very different.</p>

<p>During the ‘lean times’ (as we, the survivors, like to call them) we founded the Building Design Open Source Alliance (BDOSA). Its mandate was to share and bootstrap the AI that was built into Revit. This is a bit technical, but we made sure that BDOSA license worked for us. We shared the things we made and improved through a license written with great care. It meant that you could only use the assets if you licensed your work under the same permissive license. The cut and paste builders missed out because they were closed. This meant that when Minion-cad came out we were able to use a much richer set of details and standards than the closed source world. To a 2030 person that seems totally obvious, but it was close to heresy in 2015!</p>

<p>I said that we were able to design buildings like gods, manipulating the virtual world at the speed of thought. To begin with we thought that this would make it possible to get to the end point much faster. We were wrong; the goal posts had shifted. Just doing what we did before but faster wasn’t enough to outshine the cut and paste building enough to justify our fees.</p>

<blockquote class="pull">
  <p>We want to really understand human responses. That kind of testing is really hard, but it delivers incredible results.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>With the new expertise that our much broader skill base brought, and the things we learned from the games industry we were able to spend the time that we gained from reducing documentation and coordination on running experiments. We now run lots of simulations on every building. Most of these run at super-high-speed with minions living and working a few thousand times faster than real time. We can do things like evacuation drills easily. General things like how much walking each person needs to do in their day take a bit longer. Once we’re really happy with these sorts of things (which usually takes a couple of weeks) we move on to testing with real people. We get people in immersive environments to be in the space for long periods of time. Sometimes this can be two weeks in one go. We want to really understand human responses. That kind of testing is really hard, but it delivers incredible results.</p>

<p>People like being in VR spaces so much that we actually do quite a lot of work for companies that sell meetings. People want to meet in really inspiring spaces. We design them, but none of them will ever be built. Those projects really never end. We are constantly learning how to optimise them for different physiological responses. You want more focus? No problem! Greater creativity? You got it. The psychologists on the team love this. Turns out that people are more creative if they are a bit frightened (we get this mainly from vertigo) and people tend to be more focused in submarines!</p>

<p>We have been really busy recently. Our cities are remodelling pretty radically. People don’t ‘go to work’ anymore; they go to meet other people and explore their ideas with them. Maybe soon the VR will be good enough to make colocation unnecessary, but I think that’s a way off. When people do go to meet they go by driverless car. The buildings are emptier and so are the roads. Modifying the mix of usage so that it’s mostly residential is keeping us really busy. It’s going to be lovely; most roads are going to end up as parks!</p>

<p>It’s a whole new typology, grassy streets with fruit trees and birds. Coming full circle and putting us into a state of nature much closer to where I am now than we’ve been for a millennium.</p>

		I’ve really enjoyed this essay the most.  It’s an amazing piece of quasi science-fiction writing that actually did make me think more substantially about ‘the future’.
		<br />Well done and thank you for the effort!

        Thank you for providing this essay, I couldn’t put it down. I really hope that the BVN office of the future encourages a place to dream and not take ourselves too seriously

        On the topic of VR – In my view the parasitic, flesh bound humans, will always rely upon stimuli affect from our environment. I wonder if the next step change is to a humanistic architecture (Pallasmaa) where architecture refocuses on  experiencual outcomes driven by touch, taste, smell and sound. Or maybe this is rejected where virtual becomes real?
    </li>
    <li><span class="commenter">Rana Abboud</span>
    	Despite the onslaught of VR, our ‘fleshed bodies’ will still require physical attention. A future architect’s work will slowly shift to working in VR, while the so-called ‘real’ world becomes more concerned with accommodating our bodily functions- a split within the industry and redefinition of ‘architecture’ itself. Traditional building cannot compete with the speed of change and spectacle afforded by VR in a current world used to constant stimulation. Increasingly, the future ‘real world’ of physical buildings will provide a retreat from the virtual. As in Victor Hugo’s 19th century essay ‘this will kill that’ (referring to literary feats, over the impressive cathedral architecture of times past); VR could relegate physical buildings to a caretaker role.

        Thank you for this Essay. It was pure pleasure to read it. I liked most the idea of BDOSA licensing. It would be good idea to keep a copyright lawyer within proposed diversified team. Idea of sharing architectural ideas through licensing them could create  a constant cash-flow for the business.
		<br />This essay presented believable ideas about future: a bit like  GET SMART Agent 99’s  “shoe phone”, which become a reality.

    	In <a href="http://www.jonathanglover.co.uk/books/what-sort-of-people-should-there-be" rel="nofollow">What sort of people should there be</a> (<a href="http://www.jonathanglover.co.uk/sites/default/files/docs/what-sort-of-people-should-there-be.pdf" rel="nofollow">full pdf download of the book!</a>) Jonathan Glover goes into a series of thought experiments to help us decide if we’d be happy in an experience machine. You can basically think of this like the experience of all the people in the matrix, except they’d *know* they were in a simulation.

		He concludes that even though there’s no logical explanation for feeling it, most people would prefer to live–at least some of their life–in an authentic experience.

		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_hypothesis" rel="nofollow">Bostrom’s work on simulations</a> shows us that there is no way that we can tell if we are in a simulation or not. That means that we could actually be living in a recursive simulation (Inception style).

		I guess my point is that there’s a lot of work on VR to come, and I we’ve only really approached the visual and audio aspects so far. Once we crack the neurology of smell, touch and orientation VR might feel more real than real!

		As an aside, WSoPSTB is probably the book about philosophy that I’ve enjoyed the most. It’s clear and makes incredibly hard concepts very easy to digest. It’s also the one that I’ve found the most applicable to life since reading it.

                    <h2 class="title">Doing what good architects are good at</h2>
                    <p>I think the future office needs to focus on what good architects are good at, and what others are unable to do, or to easily do.</p>
<p>I think there are two sides to this.</p>
<p>The first and most important is the creative / design / idea / artistic realm. For someone about to spend a lot of money on a building they will want to be sure that what they are about to build is the best design they’re able to get for what they’re about to spend. I think it’s important for architects to focus primarily on this because it’s hugely important and is fundamental to all projects, and it’s what others in the property / building realm will never be able to do. Also consider that others (clients etc.) don’t know what ‘good’ is, so rely on the expert (the one the black skivvy and Braun watch) to tell them what they should like. The architect should be the professional who drives and sets the agenda for quality.</p>
<blockquote class="pull"><p>For the client the absolute validation of the value of the architect is when they see the building.</p></blockquote>
<p>The second is the surety of delivery of this fantastic design. This means not only being good enough to deliver accurate drawings (in whatever form) quickly and efficiently and on time and to program, that translate the good early ideas into the final detailed outcome, but also being involved during construction to help the clients build what they’re expecting to be built. For the client the absolute validation of the value of the architect is when they see the building. They’ve sold the design so the architect is obligated to see the project through to the end.</p>
<p>What this also means is that there are roles where architects should leave to others, such as property development, building, project management etc. I also think you can’t just do the second part. There will be plenty around who will be able to get a project completed with certainty, and do it better than an architect, but it might be average. Documentation firms I think are on a race to the bottom, and ultimately the cheapest will win, if they’re not made obsolete by new practices or methods before then.</p>
<p>I think this is probably not a big shift from what many architects are doing currently but possibly narrows the focus.</p>
<blockquote class="pull"><p>Anything the studio has developed that is not easily replicated is a competitive advantage and should be held onto tightly.</p></blockquote>
<p>For an architect studio competing for limited work against other studios, this means they must be better that others at both aspects. Better creative and better delivery. Anything the studio has developed that is not easily replicated (ideas, processes, methodology, thinking) is a competitive advantage and should be held onto tightly.</p>

<ol>
	<li><span class="commenter">Ben Doherty</span>
	<p>I’ve nailed my colours to the mast already about open source, but your final paragraph feels like it is saying the same thing. </p>
	<p><em>Anything the studio has developed that is not easily replicated is a competitive advantage and should be held onto tightly.</em></p>
	<p>Feels like the converse is also true:</p>
	<p><em>Anything the studio has developed that is easily replicated is not a competitive advantage and should be shared widely.</em></p>

                    <h2 class="title">Don’t Worry, There Will Be An AOOTF And It Won’t Be In A Vat Of Brain Juice</h2>
                    <p>This collection of thoughts (not sure whether I’m brave enough to call it an essay with all of the necessary structural requirements) is in three parts—thoughts of now, thoughts on a possible then, and about how we may go about getting there. It is predicated on our current condition, as I don’t believe that there is huge value in inventing a hypothetical future without recognising the now.</p>
<p>Importantly, I believe there will be architect’s offices in the future. This means in the immediate and the long term—architects satisfy a need and a want and hence will continue to exist. Whether or not we actually satisfy the needs and wants now, let alone then, is a different story. Architects have been around a long time, practicing their craft. I’ve been fortunate enough to work with other architects from around the world; what’s surprising is how quickly you realise that you understand each other and see things in a particular way that those outside the profession seem not to. Sure, there’s jargon and technical talk but I actually mean something different—a level of the undefined that seems to pass subliminally between us. This suggests to me that the evolution of the profession is surprisingly similar around the world, which then suggests that if everyone’s doing it (sometimes relatively independently) it is actually evolving well. Which is perhaps optimistic in a globalized society. In any case, architects do seem able to see things differently to others, which is fundamentally the point of any profession—otherwise why bother with them in the first place?</p>
<h2>However. What do we actually do?</h2>
<p>If you were to ask everyone in our practice what they thought we did I suspect there would a surprising range of answers—but not surprising enough. By this I mean the answers would probably fit within a relatively small set of possibilities and much of the differences would be about frivolities regarding processes and definitions. Arguing whether a 10mm expressed joint is better or worse than a butt join is not a discussion about architecture (to be dramatic about it). Architecture is a pretty slippery thing to define, ranging from the choice of surface aesthetics of a building (which some of our clients seem to believe is all we do) through the concept of architect as the semi-omnipotent, all-seeing and all-knowing master creator and controller of a thing (building, city, network, universe). Architectural characters in fiction are often the idealised latter, including up to the extreme of the head baddie in the Matrix trilogy. Perhaps the Director of a film is the closest analogue (but not really as they are involved in the doing not just the designing of a film).</p>
<blockquote class="pull"><p>Steve is going to architect this piece of software</p></blockquote>
<p>The term architect is used loosely across ours and other industries. In Information Technology there are software architects and enterprise architects who essentially do what we do but with IT. They’ve even turned architect into a verb, ‘Steve is going to architect this piece of software’ or, ‘this network was architected by Celine’. Architected!</p>
<p>So, to have a future (which I believe we do), perhaps we need to have an idea about what being an architect is. Without clogging this essay with a rambling discussion I propose a traditional definition—architecture is the design of things (usually buildings), using the Vitruvian ideals of commodity, firmness and delight for the benefit of people. This definition is loose enough to have a bit of wriggle room. The important bits are the words design, benefit, people, commodity, firmness and delight. You have to design something for the benefit of someone(s) that satisfies his or her base and higher needs (which are inherently indefinable). There are ethical and critical overlays to what these words could and should mean, but I’m going to steer clear of those for now.</p>
<h2>Do we do that now?</h2>
<p>Sometimes. Balancing those words is hard and can be confusing and illogical. Not just to us but to clients and ‘stakeholders’ (ie people with a vested interest in getting what they want, regardless of what others may want). It is hard, as we need to constantly make choices that affect the equation—which is the act of design. Design is about making choices to achieve a particular outcome whilst balancing the (often disparate) needs and aspirations of those things involved in that outcome. This definition encompasses architectural thought and idea. It also includes the mechanism of actualising the outcome—the plotting and scheming often required to get around the fact that we are often unable to convince uncertain clients and others of the merits of our design.</p>
<blockquote class="pull"><p>We have moved further and further away from the actual delivery of the finished thing</p></blockquote>
<p>A key layer of the current condition is the slow accretion of barnacles on our profession, which are inhibiting our ability to evolve. As an old profession we are captured by entropy—by belief systems from different eras, by legislative requirements that are now beyond our control, by tired education systems and by a vast body of architectural theory. We have moved further and further away from the actual delivery of the finished thing, with more and more layers between it and us. Sophisticated mechanisms are in place to push us still further away, which we appear to meekly accept (building is hard, messy and often unpleasant in any case).</p>
<p>The profession is in a process of fragmenting. Arguably this change is a constant of the profession from the master-builder architect to now and we shouldn’t be afraid of it. However, there seems to be a growing schism—the separation of design and documentation (which construction could be conceivably added to). As we all argue, design is a continuous exercise through the life of a project with documentation and construction merely stages. With business pressure from organisations like Ridley and Co. Atlas and others, along with the continual growth of the design architect/executive architect role we can see a disintegration of our ability to actually do what we’ve been asked to do and what our clients (and our society) would like us to do. The distance between what we do and the finished item grows further —contractors, shop drawers, project managers, site engineers, expert trades and so on end up being as active participants in the design process (even if they don’t realise it) as us. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing as long as we understand it. Or, alternatively—the further away we are the less we are needed. What is the logical end point, delivery of a seductive visualisation only?</p>
<blockquote class="pull"><p>We get paid for doing it, not for how good it is […]. Do clients actually want us to be better?</p></blockquote>
<p>We also have a flawed business model. We are paid for a delivering a thing (a drawing, report, image) but we pay for the time required to do that thing. This includes staff, rent, power and increasingly, software. So, we try and get faster at delivering, which can come at the expense of being better at it. We get paid for doing it, not for how good it is (including getting a cut of the potential benefits to a client). Do clients actually want us to be better?</p>
<p>To be fashionable, we’re ripe for disruption by a clever startup. Perhaps firms like Case and Ar-Ma are already disrupting it..</p>
<p>Ok, there’s nothing new in any of this. The profession regularly bemoans its current condition, lack of understanding and respect and so on. I imagine that all professions do so. Life’s tough.</p>
<p>I would like our profession to re-engage with the word design. Design in its truest sense, accepting the length of time, resources and effort that is required to actually design rather than assemble. I don’t mean doing everything ourselves, or believing that we are the only ones capable of achieving the result (yes, we do tend to think of clients, consultants, councils, builders and tradespeople as the enemy).</p>
<p>I don’t think the AAOTF will actually be that different to that of today, with its quirks, inefficiencies and foibles. These are important to the process. To become the AAOTF we need to change the way we think about what we do and what an architect is. The enabler of this change is technology. It won’t make us better, but it will enable us to be better if we so choose.</p>
<p>The AAOTF will use technology vastly different to today (look back to how we worked 15 years ago to get a taste of this). Hopefully in the future the technology won’t be in the way but will do what it aspires to do—automate the grind tasks (door schedule anyone?) to give time for considered decision-making. This, I hope is what the AAOTF will be about—reduced time producing drawings (or models, or virtual reality mockups or whatever) and more time interrogating the problem and the context of the problem through the lens of our expertise. This means understanding our cognitive biases, learning to think critically, reduced reaching for the previous or easiest answer and seeking understanding from outside of the profession. It also means innovating. Actually innovating.</p>
<p>The biggest barrier to this isn’t the technology itself (which is evolving so quickly that it’s fair to assume it will eventually do what it says it does now) but us. We need to stop fighting it and crawl out of our mid-20th century model of how we do our thing.</p>
<p>The AAOTF will be a great place. It will be fun, lively and clever. It will be a place where we have expertise in what we do. This expertise is nurtured and grown—and not just by learning on the job, but by constant education in many fields (using that extra time that has been freed up). We’ll continue to adjust our business model to value our services better, and to share in the benefits that these bring. This means that we will continue to get better at educating our clients and others that our expertise, training and experience is actually valuable to them. This means valuing what we do and not giving it away. We will understand the value of our IP and distribute it wisely. We will recognize the benefits of open-source.</p>
<p>We will continue to wrestle with time-based payment for resources (which will be the model for everything in the next few years). Perhaps we can evolve to valuing our own services based on time—although how long does a good idea take though? This is a conundrum.</p>
<blockquote class="pull"><p>we’ll stop saying things like ‘I just want to focus on the design.’—it’s all the design!</p></blockquote>
<p>We will become ever more curious about what we do and what others do, rather than seeing them as a threat, irrelevancies or just too damn hard. This means that we’ll stop saying things like ‘I just want to focus on the design.’—it’s all the design! This means embracing others working in and around our profession as we will have learnt to deal with management approaches that try and maintain control through speed, infantilisation of our skills and what appears to be desire to keep us wrong footed.</p>
<p>We’ll continue to expand what we do to the broad definition of design, from before the project is conceived through to assisting in the managing the finished item. Yes, to be clear, we will engage in the ongoing facilities management of the building for its entire lifetime. In essence put our money where our mouth is. Part of this means not being afraid to take back what used to be ours and perhaps should be ours—hire façade engineers, industrial designers and landscape architects; as well as shop drawers, software engineers, process engineers, real estate agents and who knows what else. A diverse practice will be a strong practice.</p>
<p>We will use new tools and workflows and not be afraid to experiment or change these quickly. These will allow us to make decisions later and later without worrying how the drawings can be changed in the tiny amount of time left (there’s that time problem again).</p>
<p>We won’t be afraid to say no and we won’t be afraid to say yes. We’ll consider decisions like any other design problem. Our teams will have reduced in size and be more diverse as technology and workflows improve. Much of what we do now can be semi-automated, imagine what this will be in fifteen years. This is the low value, repetitive work that we have to spend time doing now. This means that we will have adjusted our philosophy on risk management. Risk is an acceptable part of business (and life)—it shouldn’t be eliminated, rather accepted and used as just another tool. Others will solve issues such as data security and availability without us having to do so (this is unlikely, but anyway).</p>
<p>As individuals and as a practice we will seek agency in our work—this doesn’t mean absolute control, rather that we able to successfully influence the outcome based upon our expertise and experience (which we have significantly developed) Critical to the success of this is the need to doubt—to doubt concepts, ideas, solutions and approaches, With this doubt comes optimism—that we can improve upon these things through the application of a holistic design approach. Doubting what we do whilst being optimistic we can make it better is the conflict that forms the wellspring of fresh ideas—ideas that are truly tested, analysed and interrogated with an open understanding of our cognitive biases, limitations and capabilities.</p>
<p>Sure, we’ll have virtual reality presentation tools, rapid prototyping, though controlled design systems, hologram projectors and so on. Buildings will be part constructed by robots (who won’t be interested in drawings, only models). But these are just dressing. The real challenge will be addressing the real problem that we are given to solve.</p>
<p>How do we get there? Easy—stop fighting it.</p>

<p>The upset about the idea of someone architecting a thing is interesting. The difference between “architect” and “building designer” is a distinction that I’ve never really been able to explain in a satisfactory way.</p>
<p>I actually think it’s a good idea to separate the roles! (Cue raging mob with pitchforks!)</p>
<p>My def: To architect is a specific subset of design that is about coordinating many disparate and complex elements into a coherent whole.</p>
<p>If that works out then it doesn’t matter if you are architecting a hospital or a computer chip. I think that if we accepted that then it would release a lot of the unnecessary, pent-up anxiety that our creed has accumulated.</p>
<p>It needn’t be a problem with accreditation either, it’s just a word. You could be a registered building designer who architects hospitals and nothing would have changed except a little vocabulary.</p>
</li>

<li><span class="commenter">Ian Kirkland</span>
<p>There is a converse view to the comment that we’ve a flawed business model. </p>
<p>Pricing on fixed fee allows a practice to earn above ordinary profit on a project. Hourly rate fees mean you can only ever make the return that is built into the charge rate, and only then if the client agrees to pay for all the hours spent on the project.</p>
<p>There have certainly been examples at BVN where the client believed we had something worth paying for, we agreed a good lump sum fee, delivered the project well and made a ‘super’ profit.</p>
<p>Accountants and lawyers mostly work on hourly rates, but I’ve regularly seen discussion about getting to a fixed fee structure. BVN pays it’s accountant a fixed fee to produce a thing (it’s financial audit). The benefit is we know how much it’s going to cost, we work with them to do the job well (so they can charge the same next year) and I reckon financially they do OK out of this.</p>
<p>I guess the success of the fixed fee arrangement starts with our ability not only to value and promote ourselves, including allowing enough effort to permit good design, but also to continually live up to that promotion? Next time round the client will be more likely to pay a good price?</p>

<li><span class="commenter">Simon Swain</span>
<p>I find architecture a seductive act. The way that an architect is skilled to think skews our prism of the built and natural world. We simply can’t act without designing. Other professions don’t have this skill. If in doubt I suggest – ask your client, ask the engineer, ask the project manager. </p>
<p>They would love to have this mindset and many will agree that they are failed designers in their own mind. In understanding their deficiencies I believe that they always will seek out architects, now and in the future. They need champions of design and building, facilitators, collaborater’s and doers.</p>
<p>I believe our profession is relevant as it has been for hundreds of years. I believe that we are well placed for designing the future. I’m wonder what comes next? After our hyper post modern period</p>
</li>

<li><span class="commenter">Simon Swain</span>
<p>I also agree with this view that values our profession through respecting all participants that enable ‘design’, but bringing this back to topic about the future of our practice and profession, I wonder</p>
<p>– Is suggesting that architects are champions of design going to ’cause all the problems’?<br />
– Is this a ‘barnacles’ preventing evolution? I it ok to say that we have unique skillsets that other don’t? Is this of value, will it bring us value in the future or is rethinking and repositioning manitory for our survival?<br />
– Do we agree that architecture has instrinsic problems? Do architects have negative views of our profession. Can it be fixed? Does it need fixing?<br />
– Can architects extend their design thinking beyond our current niche? I definitely think we are well skilled. We are always talking about loosing market share. Aren’t we?<br />
– Can architects be design champions without de-valuing others?<br />
– Would other architects agree with this definition that design is “an activity of making decisions in order to reach an outcome”. Can it be reduced this basically? Does this look like MVRDV? Would Gehry or Gaudi fit this defitintion? Can process lead to desirable outcomes? Is desire measurable and axial?</p>
<p>What do others think?</p>
</li>

<li><span class="commenter">Domino Risch</span>
<p>I’m going to ask a controversial question: Is ‘design’ defined in an architects mind as pertaining to the ‘aesthetic’ – the poetry or the metaphysical concern of the thing we are making?  And the further –  is the definition of ‘architecture’ then as Ben suggests –  the coordinating of many disparate and complex elements into a coherent whole?</p>
<p>Is the element of beauty (in whatever form the architect deems beautiful) creating this schism of definition?</p>
<p>As an interior designer who cannot access the label ‘architect’  – I sometimes feel the word is perhaps over-valued, as I consider what we do as designers to be equally valid and important as what any architect can produce.  Sometimes more so because of the need that we usually have to respond to really complex functional, business and cultural drivers which designers of buildings sometimes don;t need to worry about.  And in reality – is what we do in a workplace and interiors world (where we generally don’t create the envelope for our clients – we just mush up the insides)  any different in essence to what architecture is?</p>
<p>Yet we are treated and labelled and thought of differently?<br />
I say let it go people.</p>
<p>There – controversial post done.</p>

<p>To throw in my two cents… There is a brilliant book titled Hello World by Alice Rawsthorn, where her key postulation is that despite its ubiquity, there is a lot of confusion about just what design is. She talks about everything from the design of the terracotta warriors to the iphone. I haven’t got it in front of me so I’m paraphrasing, but I like how she found the very first recorded definition of designer as someone who plots and schemes. </p>
<p>Anyway, it’s worth a read… here is some more info:<br />
<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/mar/10/hello-world-alice-rawsthorn-review" rel="nofollow">http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/mar/10/hello-world-alice-rawsthorn-review</a> </p>
<p>I think architects are specialist designers, and I think design should definitely be our number one priority – whether it be architecture or interiors, all that means is that you’re applying different technical skills to a design process. </p>
<p>It is interesting once you start looking into the design methodologies and processes of other creative fields. Sure the technical skills are different, but the methodologies run in parallel to ours. I remember watching the 2014 documentary Dior and I – about Raf Simmon’s first couture collection at Dior thinking that what we do is so similar to what he does – only at the end we have a designed space and he has a designed garment. </p>

<p>Or Objectified (or any of the Gary Hustwitz documentaries) where he explores industrial design – same design methodologies, different skills, different outcomes…</p>

<p>I read that section of the piece as a call to find a way that would motivate us to do better. We currently have a pricing structure that doesn’t benefit us extra if we are really good and is only a problem if we do our job so badly that we get sued. Wouldn’t it be nice if we could work out a way that we could earn more if we really nailed a project. I think it’d be complicated–performance contracts are slippery–but it might be a nice change.</p>
<p>As a direct question for you Ian, how much of our work comes from repeat customers? (Be that the same organisation, or the same person moving between organisations.)</p>
<p>I’m not keen on hourly rates, they devalue innovation and efficiency. I’d be really interested in working out a way that we could get “well done” bonuses without them turning into secret penalties.</p>

<a href="http://notionparallax.co.uk/wordpress/" rel="external nofollow" class="url">Ben Doherty</a>
<p>I’m going to call bullshit on the first paragraph. I think that this is exactly the mindset that is causing all of the problems. Perhaps it comes from a definition issue. Maybe we think of design as different things, so I guess I’d better put my cards on the table.</p>
<blockquote><p>Design is an activity of making decisions in order to reach an outcome.</p></blockquote>
<p>That will probably require some hedging.<br />
The outcome might not be know at the start of the process.<br />
The desire is usually for a change to be effected that can be measured on one or more axes.<br />
Under that definition a general designs a military campaign, a software engineer designs a large programme, a project manager designs the delivery of a project, a lawyer designs a contract.</p>
<p>If we use a definition of design that excludes these competencies then we are demeaning their craft. It feels to me that if we demean their craft then we aren’t inviting them to value ours</p>
<p>Our design competency is within a reasonably narrowly defined field. We would be stuffed if we needed to <em>design</em> a PCB or a sewerage system for a city. But I would imagine that an electronic engineer would be just a stuffed if they needed to design a hospital.</p>

<p>Isn’t ‘making decisions to reach an outcome’ just being alive? If I want to go to the corner shop to get a bag of chips I have to make several decisions for this simple task – how much money to take, whether to take the lift or the stairs etc… I don’t think any activity that involves thinking ahead – as you include above lawyers, project managers etc – should be called design. </p>
<p>In fact – your assumption that the other trades mentioned are also design activities might reinforce what Simon said about us (architects) carrying the designer mindset with us in our everyday lives – just because you would ‘design’ a contract doesn’t mean a lawyer would!</p>
<p>T</p>

<li><span class="commenter">Ben Doherty</span>
<p>I’d say that a lawyer absolutely would say that they’d designed a contract. The only way to find out is to ask a lawyer.</p>
<p>Designing a strategy is absolutely design. Perhaps I should add a caveat–one that Christopher Alexander has beaten me to–the distinction between conscious design and unselfconsciousness design. I can self-consciously design my breakfast routine and that’s design. Someone else could produce a contract without thinking about what they were doing (just changing the name and the date etc.). I’d say that it’s possible to design a building almost as unselfconsciously!</p>
<p>The design mindset is a bit of a slippery concept. The very slipperyness of it is what has been the downfall of the respectability of the ‘design thinking’ movement. Advocates would come to an industry and tell them about the wonders of using design thinking and the industry would say “that sounds great, but that’s what we do already, we just didn’t have a name for it.”</p>
<p>A lot of this is arguing from a position of ignorance. I haven’t really done enough reading around ‘design’ as applied in other industries. My anecdotal work from my law, medicine, software, manufacturing friends is that they all think of their jobs, or at least parts of their jobs, as design.</p>
</li>

<li><span class="commenter">Simon Swain</span>
<p>Ben – in your view how does this way of thinking position us for the future? I’m curious. </p>
<p>Any opportunities? Where should ‘design’ be positioned in the office of the future? Does it take the number one position? Where do you think it is positioned now for BVN? Is design talked about enough within the studio? Does it bubble within the studio and does our culture support this? Are design ideas and way of thinking about design interrogated enough? Do interogated design ideas lead to better otucomes and better ideas? Should we have a collective ‘approach’ to design? Is this relevant? Do our design methods leading to outcomes and built work differentiate us enough in a competitive market place? Do we want to compete at this level? Is this required of a leading edge practice?</p>
</li>

<li><span class="commenter">Ben Doherty</span>
<p>The first thing I want to say is that acknowledging that other professions also do design <em>doesn’t</em> in any way denigrate what we do. My argument (somewhat clumsily made so far) is that there is a lot to learn from all those other groups. Acknowledging that they have a lot to teach us is the first step in a giant leap in our capability.</p>
<p>As long as we <em>think</em> we have a monopoly on being designers we are propagating an arrogance that prevents learning. There are facts from other professions that we are happy to learn, but there are also methods and ways of thinking.</p>
<p>I think that design should be <em>totally central</em> to the Architectural Office Of The Future. All the drudgery that we do these days will be removed and we will do very little other than design. I think that what design means to us will change significantly. We don’t do nearly enough user research (before or after our current engagement period).</p>
<p>I don’t think that we discuss design nearly enough. We talk about its products ad nausium. If I see another person frothing over an alto vase I might lose control entirely. What we don’t talk about is methodology. Other fields have totally leapfrogged the ‘traditional’ design fields of print design and architecture. User experience design, software design and service design have all borrowed heavily from psychology and anthropology, use statistical analysis methods etc. to make sure that they are producing what people want and in the best possible way. These guys define methodologies (lean product development, human centric design etc.) and then because they are defined they can critique and improve them.</p>
<p>I’d say that the <em>only</em> way to differentiate ourselves in a sustainable way is through delivering a great product. Almost all other differentiators are a race to the bottom (cheaper, faster etc.). I’d say that thinking about being a “leading edge practice” is stupid–we either are one, or we’re dead.</p>
<p>This has probably come out very long, but I’m enjoying this thread!</p>

                    <h2 class="title">Fluid Tiling</h2>
                    <p>The Architectural Profession is at risk of having its voice drowned out if it does not move away from its reactionary position. The all-encompassing power of the Architect has been slowly diluted over the past century, yet the importance of their role as shapers of the modern city has never been so high. The profession is delicately poised moving into an era of rapid technological change. The way in which today’s profession will be able to evolve and keep its relevance moving toward 2030 is extremely pertinent.</p>

<p>Rather than speculate directly on the technological or design future, I am interested in looking at where I see architectural studios sitting within the changing context of the architectural profession. As the role of the profession grows in breadth, design studios should move toward a position of greater specialisation and collaboration, rather than attempting to touch all bases. I believe in doing so, the architectural profession safeguards itself from becoming fully subservient to rapidly evolving external environments. This will allow studios to be better equipped at responding to the broadening of the architectural context.</p>

<p>The studios ability to sustain a level of innovation is limited by the professions reliance on external market forces. Too often the ‘well-being’ and scope of innovation within studios is susceptible to the timeless rollercoaster ride of financial cycles. Globally, the last ten years has shown that architecture firms, across a range of sizes, have had to 
fight between themselves for limited opportunities. This is primarily through under cutting of fees, rather than ‘better design’. Given this, the first items to give way are chiefly the intangibles- the research, investment in new systems and progression into under-developed innovations. These represent the very same items that can be used to safeguard the practice on the next downward swing</p>

<p>The survival of an Architecture Studio is largely down to its ability to win work and then to design, document and oversee construction. The all-encompassing manner in which the majority of studios operate means that:</p>

<blockquote>No Investment in Built Form = No Architectural Practice.
</blockquote>
<p>The designer’s perspective is that they are one of the few professions that can improve people’s lives on a day to day basis. This is no doubt true, but in order to do so, there needs to be a move toward a model of practicing that shows greater resilience to these external factors.</p>

<p>FIG 01. THE CURRENT STUDIO MODEL IN RELATION TO THE ‘PRACTICE OF ARCHITECTURE’</p>

<p>The world is witnessing a shift toward more holistic thought processes with deeper outcomes. The future leaders are going through a system where undergraduate degrees are broader, and post graduate degrees are a pre-requisite to explore deeper. Similarly, leading design firms, such as SHoP Architects are using a multi-disciplinary standpoint to their advantage. Understanding architecture to be ‘the last great generalist profession’, they explain that “we really cared about theory and history and culture and beauty but we also really cared about politics and finance and technology and how those could come together”. This has allowed them to invest time and energy into the fabrication of materials and into their projects financially- a show of faith toward their own intellectual property. It is in part owing to this that their forward thinking investment has allowed them greater freedom in doing what architects do best- realising the transformative potential of the built environment.</p>

<p>FIG 02. THE CURRENT STUDIO VS THE SHOP MODEL</p>

<p>The manner in which ‘Architecture’ will shape the world will only grow with the challenges that will be posed in the future. SHoP is an outstanding model of grasping this changing architectural discourse, however, the scope and variation in how this will be achieved, will render the ability to cover the whole scope of the profession unsustainable for a single studio. Practices of the future must carve out their own spaces in this broader future as a way of securing the profession a future to shape the world.</p>

<p>FIG 03. THE FUTURE WIDENING OF BREADTH WITHIN THE PRACTICE OF ARCHITECTURE</p>

<p>The practice of the future must move away from a centralized, all-encompassing skill set and towards a refined area of expertise. The greater adaptability this will bring, will allow the profession to respond to the broadening of the professions role. Although not touching specifically on technology changes, it is important to note the role of Artificial Intelligence. As areas of architecture begin to be passed outside of human hands, it will only highlight the need for us to dig deeper in order to push past the new automated norm. These areas of expertise, or smaller fields of interest, rather than examine certain architectural typologies, will vary between the physical and virtual world. Not all studios will be focussed on delivering the built form, but will work in conjunction with other studios. As the process of superseding begins, it will be up to the practices to be constantly evolving within these fields to stay ahead of the general curve. The only way this can happen is through consistent research, we should not simply practice what we have learnt, yet develop new ideas by working from a position of strength and competitive advantage.</p>

<p>FIG 04. ‘SPECIALISED’ STUDIOS WITHIN THE WIDER ARCHITECTURAL PRACTICE</p>

<p>The movement toward specialisation does not mean that architects will lose their breadth of thought and design from an isolated viewpoint. The push toward collaborative workflow, within the architectural office and wider society, allows for intellectual problems to be understood across a greater breadth of viewpoints. Arguably, collaboration within architecture studios does not reach its full potential because the majority of the voices are singing from the same hymn sheet. The future model, will allow studios to offer and be offered more value as collaborators- intensifying the position and breadth of understanding. It is when all of these architectural or design minded ‘consultants’ come together that there is a potential for greater collaborative outcomes. People with very specific areas of expertise, yet a broad overarching background within the same framework. It could be likened to the recent move toward earlier engagement between architects and consultants, one that although at times challenging, is generally accepted to produce improved outcomes. This broad framework that fits under the realm of architecture can be chopped and changed where needed as the task requires. It also gives rise to the potential that the studios can practice outside of the traditional architectural realm. The large practice of today will be seen as clunky, as the broad thinking of one office, will be inferior to the in-depth thinking of many. This will allow the profession of tomorrow to have the best opportunity to continue in the dialogue of the greater architectural landscape.</p>

<p>FIG 05. MORE SPECIFIC COLLABORATION BETWEEN ‘SPECIALISED’ STUDIOS</p>

<p>This passage has argued that the architectural practice needs to become more specific in its focus, while architecture as a profession becomes wider in its scope. This was introduced as a response to what I believe to be the reactionary nature of the practice of architecture in the current environment. Further, it explored how the breadth and variation within architecture will render it impossible for practices to be across all facets in a world which will crave details. Finally, rather than ‘specialisation’ leading to architecture designed in silos, there will be more meaningful collaboration across the architectural realm- as opposed to collaboration between largely like-minded parties. This is my practice of the future, the collaborative practice, working in an architectural profession of greater depth and far greater breadth. Will the profession look like this?</p>

<p>Probably not- but its good fun speculating on.</p>

<ol>
	<li><span class="commenter">Ben Doherty</span>
		I had to read this a couple of times to get my head around the idea. I thought that a good way of checking that I understand it might be to summarise it.

		We have the same struggle for relevance that has shown up in nearly all the other essays–the concern that at some point in the future we’ll no longer be the apex predator of the construction/property industry. This essay seems to lay the blame for this squarely at the feet of the architecture profession. (I agree with this reasoning.) Citing competition and differentiation on fee rather than offering to be the root cause.

		I think that the claim that Architects “are one of the few professions that can improve people’s lives on a day to day basis” is a bit hubristic. That said I think that it’s just an oddly constructed intro to an important set of points. I feel like the author is posing the idea of being the ‘last great generalist profession’ as a straw man ripe for the slaughter (to painfully mix metaphors).

		What is described as the SHoP model actually fits quite well with my understanding of how science is done these days. Half a century ago people like Hooke and Wren could make significant contributions to physics, architecture, cosmology, biology and probably a heap of other fields. They made these contributions because the fields were shallow and the new weapon of the scientific method was powerful at mopping up all the obvious mistakes that their forebearers had made. My understanding is that this piece argues that architecture has reached the end of the period where great contributions are made by heroic individuals. This new period requires people–most probably groups of people–who are specifically skilled in a way that allows them to solve very specific problems.

		This is hinted at by the <a href="http://blogs.bvn.com.au/tropos/2015/02/17/16672/" title="Synthesis" rel="nofollow">Synthesis </a>essay, with its call for a “conductor” but this essay goes deeper into the implications. The conductor doesn’t play any instruments, the instruments are played by the specialist teams.

		I’d imagine that a lot of you see this as quite dystopian. You probably take pride in being a generalist. I see it as inevitable that sooner or later generalism will require people to stop ‘doing’ in a way that will move the attribution of status onto the specialists. (Maybe it’s already here and we just aren’t acknowledging it?)

<p>Over the course of 6 years and three house moves, I watched my jade tree’s slow decline. The tree grew, the pot stayed the same. I watered it the required amount, even put it outside to get some sun but the leaves just started to go yellow as the nutrients dried up. I don’t know how it survived for so long snatching what it could from the atmosphere, deep breaths that turned to shallow gasps. If only I had replenished it sooner, before it was too late…it would have had a chance to survive.</p>

<p>Anything that is living needs to have the right conditions to thrive.</p>

<p>We need to establish a creative climate.</p>

<p>My position is optimistic.</p>

<p>Architecture (in whatever form it takes) only loses its relevance when we can no longer find a way of intellectually moving forward. Our goal must be to continue to evolve and keep pace with the world in which we live and aspire to inhabit. We need to maintain our curiosity.</p>

<p>Mediocre practices will get swallowed up by large multi-disciplinary firms (AECOM, Jacobs etc.) because they can only compete on price and they can’t keep pace with change.</p>

<p>The tail end practices will dribble on…</p>

<p>The practice that thrives will occupy the space that finds relevance in leading edge or bleeding edge pursuits.</p>

<p>For quite some time, we have watched ideas come and go, occasionally they flourish and develop into something of value for the Practice. If we considered our ideas to development success rate like we do a competition, we would be disappointed with our hit rate.</p>

<p>Just like that little jade tree, we haven’t got the climatic conditions right to oxygenate ideas. If we can’t create an environment where ideas can develop then we can’t maintain our relevance.</p>

<p>Our biggest risk to our future is the lack of time, motivation and burn out of our people.</p>

<p>We need structural change to enable a culture of curiosity and create an environment where everyone is motivated to develop ideas into value adding contributions for the whole of BVN and the planet.</p>

<p>We all need to feel an internal need to act.</p>

<p>Let’s remove the barriers that exist. If we consider the burden of time and burn out as some of our major risks, we must change the way we work. We can’t keep doing the same thing and expect a different result.</p>

<p>We need an 80/20 time model. 80% BVN time, 20% individual/team pursuit.</p>

<p>Our employment contract currently restricts individual pursuit within the Practice “without the prior consent of our National Director”. If we remove this caveat and rethink the way we remunerate, this will clear some of the existing blockages and remove mixed messages.</p>

<p>How do we pay for 80/20 and allow everyone to share in success?</p>

<p>There are two parts to this.</p>

<p>Firstly, everyone receives a core salary of 80% of their salary for 80% of their time, plus the usual entitlements.</p>

<p>For the remaining 20% of earnings you have choices;</p>

<p>You can choose to work on hourly rates developing ideas or core project work for BVN;</p>

<p>You can work on your own private projects at no cost to BVN but with access to all facilities;</p>

<p>Or you can lie on the beach, spend time with the kids and not work that day.</p>

<p>This model enables the business to employ enough additional people to create time for everyone.</p>

<p>Our structure should enable us not disable us.</p>

<p>Secondly, we should have a way that everyone can share in our success.</p>

<p>Ownership could be about investing in ideas rather than an operational model of the business. The idea of ‘forever’ is defunct. Ownership can be flexible and controlled by the individual.</p>

<p>Like an internal crowd funding model, anyone at BVN can invest into ideas, projects, and initiatives that you believe will can be successfully developed, whether you are working on it or not. You could invest $1 or $1000 or your time. If the agreed measures of success (which should be based on value to the Practice not money) are achieved a dividend is paid relative to your investment.</p>

<p>20% of your time can be spent developing ideas outside core projects that will add value to BVN.</p>

<p>Our currency is our ideas.</p>

<p>We are currently habitual grazers, short of time, lightly skimming the surface off ideas without in-depth development leading to an outcome or substantial end result. A creative climate will motivate us to push through from idea to end product.</p>

<p>To improve our relevance we need to explore the potential in our projects more deeply, deliver research to the public, publish, and collaborate with outside partners to bring in expertise to subjects. This will increase our ‘value’ and allow us to create opportunities for new work, not just wait for it to arrive.</p>

<p>Yesterday I was discussing opportunities to develop applied research projects for robotics in construction with the University of Sydney…Imagine how great it would be to consistently allocate substantial time to developing innovations that you were passionate about. It could be a new model for hospitals, using drones for site specific climatic data collection, exploring the impact of the electric vehicle on our busy streets when we can’t hear or smell cars anymore.</p>

<p>We all need to feel challenged, to drive us to extend our personal boundaries, develop latent talents and explore new possibilities.</p>

<p>Why just predict the future, when we can be part of the future.</p>

<p>Once we have a thriving creative climate, we need to consider what we pursue and make good choices.</p>

<p>If we develop an ethical framework, we can act with a ‘well informed conscience’. This should include being clear about what we stand for and who we are.</p>

<p>Every day we are faced with the need to make ethical decisions. As an example, a client might have a great project that delivers a poor outcome for the community–we have to make a decision about whether we pursue the project.</p>

<p>A project is not just a project. If we believe we can be relevant, then we have to accept our actions impact the world in which we inhabit. We have a role to play in shaping our future.</p>

<p>We should be clear on our purpose, our values and our principles.</p>

<p>These should help guide us to make good decisions.</p>

<p>Work is only one part of our life.</p>

<p>If we get our climatic conditions right we can all thrive both in shared and individual pursuits.</p>

<p>Our future as architects relies on our ability to continue to be curious, adapt and solve problems creatively. As the rate of change continues to accelerate the way we currently work is becoming unsustainable if we choose to maintain our motivation and relevance.</p>

<p>Rather than throwing out the plant, let’s change the pot and tend to our soil…the rest will follow.</p>

<li><span class="commenter">Chris Bickerton</span>

OK.  I really like this essay, so I’m going to spend some time commenting on this so that I can focus on what I need to do today!  I’d also like to kick off the comments.

A confession: This is the only essay that I have read so far, having been pointed towards this by Ben, after a discussion about the ‘Google’ methodology of working, as I’ve held this method of working close to me throughout my professional career.

I’ve only worked 5 days a week on one thing two times in my entire life – I spent a summer working on a film set back in 2004, and this month will mark the first time that I have spent a full year working 100% for BVN, having spent my first 18 months here also tutoring, and finalising a few side projects that I had riding when I joined.  

What I like about the above proposal (I don’t read it as much as an office of the future, but more so as a DADB proposal, as I see the proposal as more sensible as opposed to futuristic):

1. The provision of a design ‘safety net’ – Under this system I would be able to explore other things, but be able to come back ‘home’ and work in the down periods with relative ease.  I think the ability for increased ‘play’ with less consequence can only be a good thing.

2. A system as such lets a lot of things happen – My thinking about my upcoming DADB proposal is changed significantly if such a system is in place.  The economics of any proposal seem to work a bit better if I have more freedom to allocate my time

3. Dividends = Effort.  I’d not thought of this method of remuneration before, but it seems a fair proposal.  

My questions, which I suppose are of a slightly pragmatic nature:

1. Sanctity of time.    If there is an upcoming deadline, should a project leader be able to encourage/suggest that your time be spent working towards that goal? Or should there be more hard line rules around who can influence how you use your time?   If I choose to spend this research time working on a BVN project, should it be worth the same as my 80%? 

2.  Investigating the grey areas.  I would be fascinated to discuss the difference between a project completely outside of BVN, and one of value to the company.  Where does tutoring sit, for example? Surely outside, but what if I was to present my course to BVN?  I could imagine that running a course in say, Rhino modelling and fabrication might be of interest to BVN.  Could it mean that BVN would need to outline key research objectives?  Minimum deliverables? It would be fascinating to work up a framework for the assessment of this.  Would there be a potential for being paid BOTH for external work and research within BVN at the same time?

I really like this post.<br />
I love how enthusiastic and positive it is and the ideas are great and gel with one another.<br />
The analogy underpinning it all I find troubling however; Jade trees are the only plant I have ever been able to keep alive. You couldn’t kill them if you threw them out of your apartment window, drove over them in your car and set them alight, They’re hardier than cactus! What was this person doing with their jade tree?

<li><span class="commenter">Barry Dineen</span>				

I find the 80/20 idea really interesting as something that could easily happen right now. As one possible way to make up the 20% in salary could we have an in-house freelancer style page where specific tasks and research projects could be posted with either a specific value attached or with a bidding system? That way people could compete or bid to work on things that they are specifically interested in. The person in charge of the project or task could decide who to give it to based on budget/skill-set etc. This could potentially encourage people to keep their skills up to date to get the high paying work or if its something new they want to learn they could bid low to try and get some experience in that area. 

This could be trialed in our existing structure by people who want to do extra work at the weekends or evenings (quite possible that there might not be any) to make extra cash or learn something new.

This one resonated with me too.

Agreed, a fantastic piece.

Cuts to the heart of what the practices aspirations, a move which supports creativity &amp; innovation is key.

Agree with optimism. These ideas require further exploration as part of the ‘Architectural Office Of The Future’ vehicle
<blockquote>
“We need structural change to enable a culture of curiosity and create an environment where everyone is motivated to develop ideas”</blockquote>

From a position of reflection and to assist in our own critique of the current BVN ‘culture’, I believe that the Donovan Hill office celerbrated, hoisted events and continually raised paticipant curiosity to enable a creative environment. The culture was evident from within and from outside the studio. It bubbled, it buzzed, it was the life blood of the studio. The culture assisted curiosity, interrogation of norms and historical references, it also enabled us to imagine ‘big’. 

I believe that this is an area where DHers (now BVNers) could assist,  foster and enhance our collective culture

                    <h2 class="title">INTERVIEW WITH AN ARCHITECT</h2>
                    <p class="introduction">The 21st century ushered in a radically different world than that faced by our predecessors. The rise of globalisation and the IT revolution, new technological advancements in 3D printing and Virtual and Augmented Reality have changed the way architects approach design. The increasing decline of natural resources and the threat of environmental degradation have produced a complex design environment not witnessed before. Today, in 2030, I speak with Francis Lee Williams, managing director of Williams &amp; Associates, one of Australia’s leading architectural practices about how architecture and the architectural office has developed over the past fifteen years.</p>
<p class="attribution FLW">Architect: Francis Lee Williams</p>
<p class="attribution EMT">Interviewer: Elizabeth May Toohey</p>
<hr />
<p class="editor">Editor’s note: This version is slightly different to the one in the printed version. I printed a preliminary draft. This is my fault and shouldn’t reflect on the author at all. This is the correct version.</p>
<p class="interview interview-first EMT">EMT I would like to begin by discussing some of the technological developments that have occurred over the past 15 years and how these developments have influenced the architecture and construction industry today.</p>
<p class="interview interview-first FLW">FLW The world we live in today is very much both physical and digital, with the boundaries between the two becoming increasingly vague. The use of Virtual and Augmented Reality during the design phases for example, have become commonplace in many architectural offices, including Williams &amp; Associates. In our office, we now have dedicated VR rooms with spatially immersive projected displays, Head-Mounted Displays and Mobile Augmented Reality Glasses where users interact and experience the virtual model in a fully immersive way, controlling their view by turning their head or stretching their hand. These technological advances have enabled a more intuitive interaction with the digital model, where architects can easily flip between an enveloping perspective view to a plan or section or detail with merely the flick of a wrist.</p>
<blockquote class="pull"><p>“Multiple users can now inhabit the same virtual space at the same time which provides the ideal context for a design team to examine spatial problems in a collaborative setting regardless of where they may be viewing from in the world.”</p></blockquote>
<p class="interview FLW">With Virtual Reality Aided Design we can view multiple design options instantly and switch between the architectural, structural, mechanical or the hydraulic Digital Model to help resolve design and coordination issues or highlight clashes. We can overlay information within the 3D space like never before. We can visualise the sun as it moves around the digital building, specific lateral wind loads and even earthquake loads. We can test structural capabilities of proposed materials under augmented loads and view proposed construction methods or even overlay how environmentally sustainable the building will be once complete. Multiple users can now inhabit the same virtual space at the same time which provides the ideal context for a design team to examine spatial problems in a collaborative setting regardless of where they may be viewing from in the world. With the recent satellite tracking developments we can now also augment a real site with the intended design at full scale and provide actual walking tours for clients and users. On these tours we can overlay physical presentation material such as what it will cost and how much time it will take to construct. VR and AR has allowed us to communicate with clients like never before, by fully immersing them in the digital design within its full context well before construction has commenced.</p>
<p class="interview interview-first EMT">EMT There has been reluctance from many architectural offices to integrate virtual and augmented reality into the workforce. In fact, studies have indicated that the continual shifting of the eyes which occur when using Head-Mounted Displays and Glasses compromises both cognitive and physical performance and can lead to exhaustion, disorientation, stress and anxiety. How has Williams and Associates addressed these concerns?</p>
<blockquote class="pull"><p>“VR and AR has allowed us to communicate with clients like never before, by fully immersing them in the digital design within its full context well before construction has commenced.”</p></blockquote>
<p class="interview interview-first FLW">FLW There will always be resistance to change. I believe it was Buckminster Fuller who once said “You never change things by fighting the existing reality. To change something, build a new model that makes the existing model obsolete.” I believe this quote is relevant because in many ways the new architectural reality is virtual and the old way of designing and documenting has become increasingly obsolete.</p>
<p class="interview FLW">I understand people’s reluctance to change, for the reasons you have given but also because there is a big learning curb involved in integrating new systems like this into the office. Adequate staff training is required and new job titles need to be developed, such as the ‘virtual’ model manager. However the world we live in today has a digital zeitgeist and it’s the nature of architecture that if you want to win the next big commission you need to keep up with the times.</p>
<p class="interview FLW">With regard to the health hazards, Williams &amp; Associates have addressed these concerns by enforcing mandatory ‘Tech’ free time-outs to encourage downtime. Staff have access to communal outdoor spaces to ‘unplug’ which we believe helps foster creativity. The indoor environment quality at our office is excellent, with ample natural daylight, external views, plant filled spaces, sofas and cafe tables and even sleeping areas.</p>
<p class="interview FLW">Our office is one which promotes flexibility, adaptability and mobility. Flexibility is key, flexibility in meeting and entertaining spaces, private spaces for focus work and above all, collaborative spaces. There is also flexibility in the technology we use so employees aren’t tied to a specific desk or workplace but instead are able to move about the office and are free to choose where they will work on a daily basis, including at places outside the office as more and more people are working remotely with the office just one of many destinations.</p>
<p class="interview interview-first EMT">EMT Many construction companies have also jumped on the Augmented Reality or AR bandwagon. In what ways do you think AR has affected the way buildings are constructed today?</p>
<p class="interview interview-first FLW">FLW Well, for starters, BIM data can now be geolocated on a construction site to aid with the site set out and establish site boundaries or exact alignment information. 3D instructions can now be programmed and viewed within the digital model to provide task support for assembly processes and easy access to specifications or relevant standards. During construction with AR builders can see through walls on a construction site to view pipes and mechanical ducting behind. Even after the building is complete AR overlays can now assist with complex maintenance and repair tasks on building systems. Construction has become more like assembly then what we understood it to be, say 15 years ago. There is now often a direct transition from digital to production, with digital content been sent directly to 3D printing factories for prefabrication.</p>
<p class="interview interview-first EMT">EMT Let’s talk more about 3D printing and the growth of pre-fabricated componentry within the construction industry. Multi-axis, multi-material, robotic arms can now print concrete, brick and steel components and several whole 3D printed buildings have surfaced in Sydney. With faster project completions, material efficiency, reduced labour, significant cost reductions, transportation savings and higher environmental sustainability, some have argued that 3D printing or digital rapid pre-fabrication has spawned the third era of construction technology. How has this 3D printing technology influenced how Williams &amp; Associates approach design?</p>
<p class="interview interview-first FLW">FLW Yes, it’s an interesting subject, rapid construction systems like prefabricated 3D printed building elements and CNC routed components which are based in a workshop then transported to site for quick assembly have changed the way we think about the construction process. The actual assembly process itself has also changed. There are many examples today where machines are utilised to automate acts like bricklaying with super speed and superhuman accuracy. I think in the future we will be able to utilise more robotics to complete these tasks more efficiently than ever before.</p>
<blockquote class="pull"><p>“There is now often a direct transition from digital to production, with digital content been sent directly to 3D printing factories for prefabrication.”</p></blockquote>
<p class="interview FLW">What I find most interesting about 3D printing is the use of additive manufacturing which utilises materials far more efficiently by placing material only where it is required as opposed to traditional steel or concrete structures, which have a high level of unnecessary material. This has resulted in lighter structural elements which allow new forms and shapes which have a direct relationship to the specific loads and support conditions. This fact has pushed parametricism which utilises scripting instead of sketching to generate forms. With 3D printing, complex, organic double curved structures that were previously considered impossible to build can now easily be fabricated. We have experimented with parametric design paired with 3D printing ourselves and believe we have successfully generated interesting forms with asymmetrical balance. However, I think it’s important to note that I believe there are too many buildings being designed today with this technology in ‘scripting’ offices which have uncomfortable, discordant geometries which feel jarring and disorientating. Just because the technology makes it easier for architects to design and fabricate unusual forms doesn’t necessarily mean that we should. When it comes down to it I believe that a building should be about the human interface with the physical thing, a purposeful architecture should be relatable to the inhabitant, be cohesive with ideas and meaning and be inherently performative.</p>
<p class="interview interview-first EMT">EMT I have to ask, with the technological advances in architecture which you have described, is there even a need for architects and engineers anymore? Do you think it’s possible that in the near future a programmer could take the architect’s place and the machine will do the rest?</p>
<blockquote class="pull"><p>“Just because the technology makes it easier for architects to design and fabricate unusual forms doesn’t necessarily mean that we should.”</p></blockquote>
<p class="interview interview-first FLW">FLW No, I don’t think so. I believe the ‘machine’ is only ever as good as the designer behind it. While I agree that technology has allowed us to access an unprecedented amount of information, it is still just a tool. Software doesn’t acknowledge the creative process. Architecture is born from an idea, a central idea which is project specific and which is synthesised in the human brain. This idea can be derived from a whole assortment of influences including issues which may be more transcendent than the architecture itself. Software cannot possibly appreciate this. An architect is taught and educated in the needs of society and gives a design purpose so that it can respond to natural human occupation. This is the same for engineers who need to use their intellect and feelings to respond to a specific design issue. It is inevitable that there will be design issues or complications through the design process. This is partly because we are designing for people and people often have fluctuating requests. It is the design teams job to be fast on their feet and be prepared to abandon an idea to help the project get to where it needs to go next and to achieve an integrated whole. Software couldn’t respond to this without a skilled team operating it because it is a very human response.</p>
<p class="interview interview-first EMT">EMT Do you think that the traditional model of architect with a large team of consultants including a structural engineer has changed?</p>
<p class="interview interview-first FLW">FLW Yes, generally speaking the design team is a much more collaborative and integrated. I’m not saying that the architect’s role has declined but I think that the collaboration is much more defined with specific experts working towards a common goal. The complexity of the 21st century’s problems and the environmentally sustainable obligations that buildings perform highly throughout their life, has caused this shift.</p>
<p class="interview FLW">Not so long ago, it was the architect’s job to design and the engineer’s job to size this design for construction. Today the boundaries between the two disciplines have dissolved and we work together as one. For example, it used to be common that there was a designated structural zone to a building and the architect effectively ‘dressed’ the structure up by cladding around it and concealing it. Today the form itself is often both structural and architectural which I think is a far more sustainable approach.</p>
<p class="interview interview-first EMT">EMT I’m glad you raised environmental sustainability. Can we talk about Australia’s changing environmental conditions and the influences they have had on the buildings we design. I am particularly interested in the new green building typology of Vertical Farming.</p>
<p class="interview interview-first FLW">FLW Vertical Farming emerged in Australia over the last 10 years in response to climate change, the food crises and crippling water shortages. After continuing droughts caused the ban on irrigation at the Murray Darling Basin it caused ruin to many farmers. The basin once provided 85% of the water used nationally for agricultural irrigation. A ‘food crises’ emerged in Australia and with the ever increasing food price rises, It soon became clear that we needed to abandon the ‘traditional’ agricultural model and replace it with controlled environment agriculture or CEA.</p>
<p class="interview FLW">With the growing population and increasing urbanization it was also evident that urban agriculture was needed to grow food sustainably at a high yield scale in dense metropolitan regions like Sydney. Space and decreased fertile land were clearly a problem which ultimately led to the rise of Vertical Farming in Australia.</p>
<p class="interview interview-first EMT">EMT One of your most recently completed buildings – ‘Greendale’ is an 8 Greenstar rated high density, mixed-use high-rise which incorporates a Vertical Farm. I would like to finish today with you talking about this award winning building.</p>
<p class="interview interview-first FLW">FLW Greendale combines one hectares worth of growing space in a vertical farm with a 40 floor office tower, an apartment tower and commercial/retail in the podium level at the new agricultural precinct in Black Wattle Bay, Sydney. The Vertical Farm component is basically a series of greenhouses stacked vertically. The controlled indoor environment means no weather related crop failures due to droughts, floods or pests and year round crop production organically grown in a soilless hydroponic growing medium. The crops in the controlled environment don’t need herbicides, pesticides or fertilizers and by recycling black water we have virtually eliminated agricultural runoff which is the world’s greatest source of pollution. Australia is the driest inhabited continent in the world and with global warming and the changing climate, water shortages will continue to be a problem. Greendale’s Vertical Farm addresses this by using 95% less water to grow crops than traditional methods and the total water supply for the building is harvested and treated rainwater. Oil shortages and oil price rises are another big issue and reducing the distance from ‘paddock to plate’ has significantly lowered the amount of fossil fuels needed to deliver food to the consumer, reducing the amount of greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p class="interview FLW">Greendale is a highly technological, zero carbon emission ‘eco’ high-rise. The structure employs several energy producing technologies including a solar array and wind turbines on the roof and a methane gas generating plant in the basement. Recent technological advancements in generators have allowed the massive amounts of pruned plant organic waste or biomass from the vertical farm to be recycled to produce methane. This methane gas is burned to create electric energy which is used throughout the Vertical Farm, offices and apartments. Ecologically generating energy from biomass closes the carbon cycle which means the structure does not contribute to the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.</p>
<p class="interview FLW">The organic ‘bean’ shaped form of the building optimise ideal day lighting and views. The South facing offices have sweeping views over the city skyline and the curved apartment tower allows for views over the harbour. The double curved ETFE Vertical farm façade to the North relates to the winter sun path. Virtual and Augmented sun studies during design ensured that a consistent transmission of natural day lighting was uniformly distributed to the shallow farm floor plates. Low energy LED ‘grow lights’ ensure the crops continue to develop 24/7. The 50 meter long, prefabricated strips of ETFE are the skin of the building and are a much more sustainable alternate to glass and absorb less UV light which is essential for photosynthesis and plant growth. On several floors communal sky-courts recreate the ground level environment in the sky and allow for outdoor landscaped retreat spaces with café and BBQ facilities for the office staff and apartment occupants.</p>
<blockquote class="pull"><p>‘Architecture is born from an idea.’</p></blockquote>
<p class="interview FLW">To finish, I’ll say, Greendale is a great example of how contemporary technologies can be successfully utilised to design and construct a purposeful, inherently performative, beautiful building that responds to climate change and the needs of society in 2030.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed this.</p>
<p>The reference to ‘parametricism’ got me thinking. Most of ‘us nerds in the trade’ got really annoyed by Schumaker’s pontification. His coining of the term, and defining it as a style not an approach undid a lot of the work we’d put in. (By ‘we’ I’m being arrogant and including Coates, Hillier, Steadman etc.)</p>
<p>By 2030 the ‘style’ might have matured to just mean a form that appears to have been achieved through <em>a process that is inscrutable to a human</em> in some way. I like that you’ve brought it back to pure structure–Gaudi would be pleased.</p>
<p>I disagree with the idea that AI software is doomed to always be “just a tool”. It’s similar to the <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/chinese-room/" rel="nofollow">Chinese room argument</a> and I don’t think it matters if the computer can think as long as it gives us a response that makes us think that it can think! I’d imagine that a lot of people disagree with me and I’d be interested to hear how. I think that computers will become indistinguishable from humans on certain classes of task sooner than we think. (Class specific AI is far easier than fully general AI.)</p>
<p>I thought that it was interesting that you also said “that a building should be about the human interface”. I get a lot of human interface discussion at home and it feels as if we are lagging behind professions where interface design is an explicit part of the brief. The testing structure mentioned in <a href="http://blogs.bvn.com.au/tropos/2015/02/15/31130-645pm-dear-diary/" rel="nofollow">Dear Diary,</a> sounds like it’d work well at Williams &amp; Associates.</p>
<p>I’ve always had a bit of a thing for urban agriculture. I wonder what would happen if you tried to make a building as self sustaining as possible.</p>
</li>

<li><span class="commenter">David McGirr</span>
<p>I thought this was a really novel response to the brief. Reading it really felt like a real interview (even if you didn’t agree with all of the content).<br />
I wondered if there was some meaning in the names of the participants – Toohey was a character from Fountainhead (saying Ayn Arand ‘isnt my favourite Author” would be an understatement I think, it certainly provokes a response ast least) and no prizes for guessing what FLW stands for in the modernist canon. Probably just coincidence</p>
</li>

<li><span class="commenter">Katherine Withnell</span>
<p>I loved this! I particularly (and predictably) liked where FLW commented on how if architects want to win the next big commission they need to keep up with the times. We need more focus more on research, emerging trends and technologies in our submissions. (so if the writer of this essay wants to help me with that, I’d really appreciate it!)

<p>“I wonder what would happen if you tried to make a building as self sustaining as possible” BD</p>
<p>I think that would be great Ben, but I would imagine we’d likely be kicked out of the meeting and told we are making the building too expensive!</p>
<p>There is a tendency in these discussions for architects to assume that we have much of a say in what actually gets built…we already have loads of great ideas for how to make buildings ‘better’…but it is the financiers, the developers and their views of ‘the market’ that tend to dictate the brief…each with their own risk management structures to ensure the project is within a standard deviation of their competitors.</p>
<p>There hasn’t been much about how architects might be able to have more of an influence in the work that occurs before architects even get involved in a project. I wonder how we can improve the expectations and broaden the possibilities for projects without relying on the occasional state politician to advance the issue.</p>
<p>“Architecture is born from an idea”, but unfortunately, its rarely the idea of an architect. Given our current role of basically making the building look nice and work well inside the parameters set by higher powers [not an insignificant role it must be said], there is a danger that we retreat into the position of specialist form makers, while the big decisions are made by others.</p>
</li>

<li><span class="commenter">Joe Banks</span>
<p>Thanks Michael, that’s a great point, I was talking to a student the other day bout how the role of the architect is betrayed as having this design freedom that lets you design and develop building only limited by your imagination and physics. however in reality most buildings are driven by cost and fairly limiting client/developer brief.</p>
<p>I don’t know any architects that have managed to build exactly what they wanted to for a client, the only real outlet for most of us is when you are designing your own home and you still have pretty high financial pressures on an architects salary.</p>
<p>Is the trick here to demonstrate the financial benefit of good design? do explain our design through the eyes of an economist?</p>
</li>

<li><span class="commenter">Ben Doherty</span>
<p>This demonstration of value is talked about in <a href="http://blogs.bvn.com.au/tropos/2015/03/06/31130-645pm-dear-diary/" title="31/1/30 6:45pm - Dear Diary," rel="nofollow">Dear diary</a>, It needn’t be explicitly financial value, but often things tie back to money. We really need to start to <em>demonstrate</em> some kind of value rather than talk about ‘enlightened clients’ who just ‘get it’. It’s our job to make them get it!</p>
</li>
					
<li><span class="commenter">Joseph O'Meara</span>
<p>Hey guys, Interesting comments, thanks! </p>
<p>In this piece ‘Greendale’ isn’t so much ‘the idea of the architect to make a building as self-sustaining as possible’ but rather a necessary development responding to the state of the hypothetical environment in 15 years. It’s a response to climate change, droughts, scarce resources, the food crises, urbanisation and above all the increasing population. I don’t think this is too far-fetched given that in the last 45 years the world’s population has literally doubled and it’s growing by over 200,000 daily! </p>
<p>I was surprised the environment and ESD wasn’t really a pop topic in these essays. I think ESD will be more intrinsic in all development in 15 years, not by choice but by necessity. While ESD is definitely more ingrained in architecture today than it was 15 years ago, buildings are still the single largest contributor to the world’s greenhouse gas emissions, which is clearly a problem. </p>
<p>I agree with the comment above that “most buildings are driven by cost”. I think this is the main reason why currently no freestanding high-rise vertical farms exist today because potential funders and stakeholders remain unconvinced that such a radical departure from conventional agriculture and urban development will be financially feasible. However if I were to look at ‘Greendale’ “through the eyes of an economist” I would suggest that eco-nomies like any eco-system are stronger when there is a diverse range of economic relationships and combining the profits of the office block, apartment tower and retail space, with the profit from the Vertical Farm secures the profitability of the entire mixed-use structure. The whole becomes greater than the sum of the parts. I think government subsidies, carbon trading, energy savings through reduced operating costs, energy generation and the political, social and environmental benefits would be attractive to a variety of developers. </p>
<p>Food for thought. ;)</p>

<p>Hey Ben, thanks for the comments! Now that our identities have been revealed I can safely reply to these without letting the cat out of the bag. :)</p>
<p>I don’t think Francis was suggesting “AI software is doomed to always be just a tool” but rather using virtual and augmented reality to design buildings still requires a designer to operate them. I think VR and AR have endless possibilities in architecture in the future which I talked about in the piece, however I think that even with advanced technological advancements there will still be a need for architects because software doesn’t acknowledge the creative process which is a very human response.<br />
This is the opposite take on the more dystopian views some have suggested in their pieces whereby AI has spawned the end of the architect.</p>

<p>Hey David, well spotted! FLW was referring to Frank Lloyd Wright and EMT was referring to Ellsworth Monkton Toohey. This was for no real reason other than Wright is arguably the most famous architect and Toohey is a famous fictional architectural critic, interviewer and writer.<br />
No greater meaning behind it. :)</p>

                    <h2 class="title">Leading edge practice is stupid. We either are one, or we’re dead</h2>
                    <p>Will we be relevant in the future or are we just another mediocre practice? What would our peers and clients say of us? Some of our key principles are listed by us as design focused and innovative. But do we really produce exemplary design outcomes and innovative solutions? Is design excellence relevant and is it relevant for all projects? Or are we a safe set of hands, reliable, dependable, predictive. Is this more important or as important?</p>
<p>In my view to be really innovative, to be really ahead of the curve or even set the curve you need to take risks. Does the current business model support risk taking behaviour? Would our current client base support risky moves? Should our buildings challenge predictable and current norms? Is the relevant to future practice? Do we provide solutions that are based on research, enabling our own unique solutions? Or are we and the profession happy to continually refine and extend historical and modern ideas. Will these be relevant in our 21st century? Will we be manoeuvrable enough to dare to be different to create our own unforeseen relevancy?</p>
<p>A suggestion. Break the business. BVN provides a safe set of hands to support our way of life and NVB (the new) is created and subsidised by BVN to be risky, nimble, inventive, researched based. Able to fail. Success within NVB provides a way forward for BVN and it doesn’t bet the bank</p>

	<li><span class="commenter">Paul Wintour</span>
	<p>I find this article interesting. In quite a few AOOTF articles the authors talk about research and innovation. But what does that mean – what do we want to research and what are we trying to improve by innovating?</p>
	<p>If I understand this article correctly it is suggesting we create a sister company that is completely unaccountable and ‘able to fail’. I think if this idea is to get any traction and succeed (because that’s what we want, not failure), we need to be clear of NVB’s purpose.  Research, and by extension innovation, comes in many different forms. Here are a few quotes from my good friend Wikipedia:</p>
	<p>•	“Basic research is executed without thought of a practical end goal, without specific applications or products in mind.”
	<br />•	“Applied research deals with solving practical problems and generally employs empirical methodologies.”
	<br />•	R&amp;D which “differs from the vast majority of corporate activities in that it is not often intended to yield immediate profit, and generally carries greater risk and an uncertain return on investment…Research has shown that firms with a persistent R&amp;D strategy outperform those with an irregular or no R&amp;D investment program.”</p>
	<p>So we can either have an end goal in mind which will likely return an incremental change/improvement. Or we could have no end goal which is riskier and potentially generate much better results. We need to define ourselves somewhere within this spectrum. Mies van der Rohe once said (and I paraphrase), it’s better to master than to innovate. Do we want to master what we already know, or do we want to create something that doesn’t already exist?  So how can we decide which things need incremental improvements and which things need major innovation?</p>
	<p>So many times in a working day we see things and ask ‘why?’ –  Why do I have to go upstairs to go down stairs (happens all the time in Asia!)? Why are so many offices depressing when there is so much research on workplaces? Why are we spending money on roads when the public transport is so hopeless? Why do airlines SMS me a boarding pass only to print it out at the gate? Surely there must be a better way. Yes it might be the way we were taught as the ‘correct’ way, but deep down we know it can be improved. I see the futures forum as an opportunity of not only making BVN better, but the architectural profession as a whole. The architectural profession I would argue is still in a ‘high-Modernism’ phase. We are more or less designing buildings the way the Modernists did a 100 years ago. There have been a few movements in between, such as post-modernism and brutalism, but none that are still regularly practiced. How comfortable are we with this? Are we happy with the architectural status quo? For some, if a building doesn’t look like a Modernist building, they just look “weird”. We can either accept this or challenge this? I strongly believe we need to challenge this. So many buildings just accept their typology because that’s the way we’ve already done it…And this is where I think research fits in. By stripping away pre-conceptions and taking a fresh perspective. Basing every single decision on performance: What’s the most efficient structural system (it’s not the Domino!)?; What’s the best environment to make users have a healthy life?; What’s the best configuration to get the best yield for the client? Research teams could then focus on highly specific aspects of a building, instead of being responsible for the entire project. This is how nature works and how the automotive and aviation industry design. Quantifiable, specialised, responsive.</p>

                    <h2 class="title">Let’s say…</h2>
                    <p class="introduction">Let’s say the future is 15 years away.</p>
<p class="introduction">Let’s say we are still an architecture practice</p>
<p class="introduction">Let’s say I’m still here.</p>
<p class="introduction">What will be different?</p>
<p class="introduction">Physical stuff: People. The space. The technology. Paper.</p>
<p class="introduction">The other stuff: Culture. Behaviour. Strategy.</p>
<div class="idea-box">
<h2>PEOPLE:</h2>
<p>Our people are our greatest and in some ways, our only asset. Without them, the archived projects, the photos, the models are all somewhat meaningless. In 15 years we will still have people. Our people ARE our business. I think people will still come to work. I think a studio environment that provides opportunities for conversations, review, discourse, a place for teams to bond and thrive will still be essential. It’s about being together, engaged and open to new ideas—spending time alone at home or remotely does not develop people necessarily, it develops work (which is important) but not everything. There are more of us, or less, but we are vibrant, confident, inquisitive and energised. We are determined, we are strong, we have ability. We are leaders, not followers. We embrace others and always seek to learn.</p>
</div>
<div class="idea-box">
<h2>THE SPACE:</h2>
<p>In 15 years we are somewhere else. We have less desks than people. We have more spaces for design oriented collaboration—pin up space, projection space, video and phone conference space. We have more spaces for retreat and individual work. We might stand up to work and only occasionally sit down. We might arrange ourselves in groups and teams, but we accept that some of us are mobile and our business is more done outside of our space than in it. We use our space as an incubator. We test installations. Ceiling types. Floor finishes. Wall claddings. Furniture. We see all sorts of people in the space—not just our own and those we are immediately working with. People come to see us not because we are an architecture practice, but because we are innovators. We inspire others from unrelated fields to see what our people and our space—our business—have achieved.</p>
</div>
<div class="idea-box">
<h2>THE TECHNOLOGY:</h2>
<p>Computers and their bits are smaller in 2030. I hope there is less screen space so we can see each other more and actually talk. There are no fixed desk phones. There are no CPUs. Large monitors for team discussions are common. Large format touch screen tables are everywhere—like an iPad but A1 format for sketching (is there any yellow trace anymore???) Wireless headsets. I have a Microsoft Surface with phone functionality—combining as many objects into one as possible. Booking a meeting room is easy (not like in 2015!). Email is much less prevalent but at the expense of other ways of connecting: IM / social media / Google hangouts increasing? Data is in the cloud and accessible from absolutely anywhere, making working remotely no different to being in the studio. We use new forms of software in experimental ways. We can even do our timesheets from home. We might have a digital person at reception—freeing Fiona to be our emotional salve and organisational champion from wherever it suits her.</p>
</div>
<div class="idea-box">
<h2>PAPER:</h2>
<p>In 2030 there is still paper. Some people can’t let go. Most of us scanned our crap years ago. Paper is not spread across the entirety of our working surfaces, if needed it is on walls, or in neat piles in cabinets. We might mark things up by hand still but we don’t keep hard copy when done—scan scan scan. We threw out our shop drawing stamp at least a decade ago when everyone finally learned how to stamp a PDF. What we do have though is books. Visual inspiration. Magazines and research papers. Newspapers are perused by shared tablet and AIO PCs that are around everywhere. Murdoch press abandoned gateway accounts 5 years ago—online access to papers is free.</p>
</div>
<div class="idea-box">
<h2>CULTURE:</h2>
<p>We have changed. REALLY. Compared to 2015 we have more emotional intelligence. Most people think about and are aware of how their behaviour affects others. Voice of judgement, voice of fear, voice of cynicism—they are still there, but under control. We love having our children and our pets around. We cultivate difference. Different ways of being engaged with US. Sometimes obvious, sometimes not. IT’s OK to work hours that suit you. It’s OK to work from somewhere else. It’s OK to be provocative and challenging, but it’s NOT ok to be disrespectful. Life happens at work. Work is not where you are, it’s what you do. It’s OK to get your dry-cleaning, take the kids to the park, see your mum. We TRUST you, or you wouldn’t be here. We are engaged and passionate, we love what we do.</p>
</div>
<div class="idea-box">
<h2>BEHAVIOUR:</h2>
<p>We are above all, professional. Our behaviour between ourselves and to our clients and industry peers is representative of our organisation. We are prepared, diligent, advanced. We under-promise and over-deliver. We understand that we are in the service industry and that our clients are the originators of, and the beneficiaries of our successes. They are NOT obstacles to be manoeuvred around, they are not the enemy. We dress for success—we look sharp. Impressions matter. We manage our time properly. In 2030 we turn up to meetings—even internal meetings—on time, because we are respectful of others.</p>
</div>
<div class="idea-box">
<h2>STRATEGY:</h2>
<p>It’s 2030 and our business model has changed. We moved away from being one off, single project ‘problem solvers’, to being more like an accountant (eeewwwwww) that is a trusted advisor who consults on a range of things. We have long term partnerships with our clients. We are involved in a range of areas—strategy, leasing, development, culture, engagement, health and wellbeing, research and development, productivity. We have expertise in all these areas. We work not only with the end users of the places that we create, but those who are instrumental in advising those end users. We work with developers, leasing agents, property owner and community groups. We work with governments at all levels. We don’t just solve one problem, we solve multiple problems. We are business partners not just architects.</p>
</div>
<p class="introduction">2030 seems so far away. But it’s not. Before you know it we will be there. What I’ve written is what I am passionate about—our culture. But what it really boils down to is people and relationships. If we get better at managing those, our business will get better, too. Better enough to get us to 2015 in amazing shape.</p>

	<p>This is great. It feels like it might be what things will be like in 15 years, but really there’s nothing stopping us doing all of these things right now!</p>
	<p>I find that we have a historical culture of pretty severe paternalism. That’s slowly changing, but I really like the line: “<em>We TRUST you, or you wouldn’t be here.</em>” I haven’t found a single situation where hiding information from my colleagues has been beneficial. Yet it is the default, safe position for a lot of things. I’d certainly join a call for greater transparency!</p>
	</li>

	<li><span class="commenter">Glenn Irwin</span>
	<p>I think the paper aspect of the office will be a lot more immediate and transparent in the near future.<br />
	I imagine that given recent progresses with Nano paper devices and wet/dry technology will mean our tablets, project record pads, sketch pads, scanners and screens, newspaper etc will be all one device and immediately recorded to clouds. Its flexible (or not), physically scale-able and appears or disappears whenever you like. No more having to carry stuff except for the various quantum processors and comms devices planted under your skin.</p>
	<p>The device is not only physical but stretch it over you and become immersive. Today when you look around at all the faces planted in screens tomorrow will be a workplace ballet of people moving through a series of virtual dance moves as they meet with clients and showing them through their future design concept. Its often  referred to as song and dance session.  </p>
	<p>Transparency and work will be ubiquitous by nature in the future realm. Not just in the workplace but everywhere. Like the smallest molecule can be located, positioned and governed; work will flow from us like an immersed synestheasia of experiences that is recorded and driven to its data cloud. </p>
	<p>Perhaps the physical world will become less interesting and almost abandoned for a much more controllable and augmented sense of reality.  Existenz.</p>
	<p>One may need to work hard to secure anything private and “retreaters” will form a new world of seclusion.<br />
	Life in “beefspace” however will be like moving through a series of thresholds that engage your senses at various public/private levels. What we have already as a structured public/private society will seem blended, dissolved. After-all isn’t work and non work already a blurred boundary.</p>
	<p>My brain hurts…lunch!</p>

	<p>2030 seems like an exciting place to work! The essay paints a bright future for our industry, with many developments that would greatly enhance the way we work. I am looking forward to having less paper and clutter around, with a more streamlined environment.</p>
	</li>

	<li><span class="commenter">Jessica Enander</span>
	<p>I agree, I very exciting future to look forward to!<br />
	Just as the author noted “Life happens at work. Work is not where you are, it’s what you do”, I believe this is the way forward culturally. As younger generations of architects and designer enter the workplace – a need for a  flexible, collaborative and transparent work culture will be what engages us and ignites our creativity. A sense of ownership will increase our productivity and hopefully the new technology will enhance our efficiency. Bring on 2030!</p>
	</li>

	<li><span class="commenter">Fiona</span>
	<p>Bendy, I have found that there a couple of common denominators when it comes to people coveting information…..here it is, for what its worth.<br />
	Information is power – I believe people who may feel insecure, not necessarily at work, but perhaps in their private life, can be information hoarders.  I guess it makes them feel they have something up their sleeve to use on their terms.<br />
	Some people just don’t get it – for some it just doesn’t occur to them that people need to know, for others I think its a case of ‘why should I tell them, it doesn’t concern them’<br />
	Whether this be true or not, I agree, hiding information is rarely beneficial and more often than not, leads to misunderstandings and avoidable frustration.</p>
	<p>(p.s.  I was honoured to be named in this essay – thank you Dr/ Mr/ Mrs/ Ms/ Miss Anon)<br />

<p class="introduction"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Put simply In 15 year’s time, the Architectural Office (and practice in general) will be one in which the most progressive firms have completed a strategic pivot (shift in their core business) from Building Information Modelling (BIM) to People Information Modelling (PIM)<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://tropos.bvn.com.au/2015/03/11/pim-and-the-living-lab/#fn-9818-2" id="fnref-9818-2" onclick="return fdfootnote_show(9818)">2</a></sup>. The rationale for the shift can be summarized in the following 8 points<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://tropos.bvn.com.au/2015/03/11/pim-and-the-living-lab/#fn-9818-3" id="fnref-9818-3" onclick="return fdfootnote_show(9818)">3</a></sup>:</p>


1. It will be an extension of a historical progression we can already see taking place; from a preoccupation with form as Architecture’s primary concern (modernism/20thC +prior) to the current preoccupation with environment (habitat, space, urban realm) as architecture’s primary concern.
1. This current condition of environmental concern has the paradoxical effect of creating a more anthropocentric (human centred) approach to design; as clients + the public in general gain a greater awareness of the effect of environment on themselves physiologically.
1. This heightened physiological awareness will come primarily from the increase in digital surveillance + wearable technology which easily measures, analyses (and often shares through cloud and IoT) personal bio-metric data such as heart rate variability, skin conductivity, pupil dilation, salival cortisol (stress hormone) levels and much more.
1. These biometric markers (many of which directly relate to wellbeing and stress levels) can dramatically change in response to a persons’ environs, the current fascination with the data and the technology itself (smart watches, phones, smart TVs, web cams, etc.) will soon progress to an interest in how the environment changes the data (i.e. health of the person) for better or worse.
1. This is the point at which Architects will/must situate themselves in the future; As smart spatial practitioners who (in response to such datasets) can manipulate space in real time/near to real time in such a way that it will have demonstrable impacts on people’s bio-metric data that can be seen instantly experienced + analysed, with the space itself being refined again based on the data (this process continues indefinitely).
1. This process is known as bio-feedback; used in scientific physiological research for decades, its only relationship with Architecture currently is that it is loosely analogous to some parametric design processes (mainly relating to form rather than user experience). it is also used in some building services systems (e.g C02 monitoring) at a bulk occupant level. In the future however, true physical Architectural bio-feedback loops will be as normative as ESD is today.
1. An example—an Architect in the future is engaged to fit out a workplace for a law firm; Rather than leave the client after construction services, the architect designs the space to a point where it can be occupied and business engaged. The architect then monitors workers bio-metric data for positive + negative trends of the occupants and continually redesigns elements within the space for the duration of the tenancy (decades if necessary). The law firm uses this process as the primary component of their overall wellbeing strategy to attract + retain staff. The best Architects are the ones who can maintain bio-metrics which continue to trend positively through constant refinement of the elements which affect those markers (light, sound, air ergonomics, way finding etc)
1. This sees consumers themselves (workers, patients, punters, clients, whatever you want to call them) as the primary engine of space creation, rather than passive subjects whose comfort is important but (by and large) is not really seriously measured or quantified in any meaningful way.

                    <h2 class="title">Practice driven by people who are still practising.</h2>
                    Practices continue to grow and evolve driven by external factors such as time, cost, technology and economy. Yet, other internal factors such as the core traits, skills and principles of individual people have by 2030 come to more strongly drive not only the way in which we work, but practice our profession more broadly. We are not a practice driven by a singular person or figurehead or even a few. We are now a &lt;insert collective noun here&gt; conscious collaboration of people, of architects. We are people influencing not just how people live in the way in which we design the built environment, but our practices now more strongly than ever influence policy and shape society.

<blockquote class="pull">Practices of 2030 will be driven by some of the best educated adults that our society has produced to date.
{:class="pull"}

Generationally, the people who will power the workforce in 2030 have grown up in a more socially conscious, environmentally sustainable era. They critique current practices in policy, efficiency, workflow and society. They call them ‘Millennials’ or Generation Y. Their collective traits are what is pulling practice in many fields in a new direction. Their generational ideologies and aspirations direct not just what work they do, but how they do it. As a cohort they feel collectively ‘special’. They have inculcated a sense of feeling that they are not only important to their parents, but vital to the nation and the world. They are confident. They come with positive solutions for the big problems and they are upbeat about everybody’s future. They play as a team, with a rising sense of civic engagement, yet they are socially liberal. They feel pressure to perform and excel in work and in play. They focus on achievement not merely for themselves; but for others. Practices of 2030 will be driven by some of the best educated adults that our society has produced to date.

These are not traits that have generally been associated with the generations that have come before them. The Silent, Baby Boomers, Gen Xer’s. In fact these core traits have not been seen since the G.I Generation. for those of you who don’t know who they are—they are the ‘Greatest Generation;’. Those who grew up in the time of the Great Depression, and who went on to fight in World War II. Their productivity was integral to the war effort.<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://tropos.bvn.com.au/2015/03/11/16892/#fn-9813-1" id="fnref-9813-1" onclick="return fdfootnote_show(9813)">1</a></sup>

Gen Y’s cultural attitudes, liberal ideals and general positivity to solving problems has led to a more transient and collaborative way in which we work—we practice with an increasing number of “non-architects”, not just those in creative fields either, but those in science, business and economics, particularly humanitarian and developmental fields. The Millennial’s socially conscious, environmentally sustainable way toward the future shapes their lifestyle and work.

<blockquote class="pull">The term think tank has become almost irrelevant
{:class="pull"}

This is a future where people are no longer interested in simply ‘making a donation’, but ‘crowd-funding’ and not just monetary funding either. Practices and industries powered by individuals barter their services, their skills, and their expertise. The increasing prevalence not only of technology but also of social conscious work and encouragement of thought processes outside of the box has led to this diverse manner in which we now come to operate. The term think tank has become almost irrelevant, as each industry practices in thought, each industry works in symbiosis.

Pushing and driving this undercurrent of togetherness and well-being are increasing population and depleting resources. These are issues this generation has grown up acknowledging; and now have the power to address. The consideration of unevenly distributed wealth and the socially conscious way in which this generation was raised has come to have resounding impact on this generation’s sense of civic; and ultimately global, duty. Australia, with one of the fastest growing OECD growth rates in the world, will be coming to terms with aligning economic prosperity with population growth and urban development. By 2061, our cities will all have doubled in size, with 74% of Australians being accommodated within capital cities.<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://tropos.bvn.com.au/2015/03/11/16892/#fn-9813-2" id="fnref-9813-2" onclick="return fdfootnote_show(9813)">2</a></sup> The people and practices of 2030 will be the ones addressing these fundamental changes to our society.

Practice itself, although many will speculate–would become increasingly fragmented with technology enabling many to work from home, will in fact have become even more collaborative. Technology, and its ingrained place with this generation, whom have grown as it has, has the opposite effect. They will utilize this technology as an improved means to collaborate with those overseas and interstate. Better researching and exploring problems and their solutions. Practice with one another will become more collaborative and involved in office at the same time, possibly replicating the way in which our cities have become increasingly congested.

<blockquote class="pull">Millennials …&nbsp;think outside the box&nbsp;…&nbsp;and thus, drive change.
{:class="pull"}

There are examples of more fine grain approaches to this beginning already. These pilots will be expanded upon by these upcoming Millennials, who look to the Gen Xers who have come before them for innovation. Those born under Gen X were (and are!) as a cohort typically sceptical, pragmatic, but with a lack of organised loyalty, always questioning authority (not always a bad thing!) and importantly raised to think globally. Gen X were shaped by events such as dual income parents, the rise of AIDs and HIV, fall of the Berlin Wall, the Chernobyl disaster, the end of apartheid and the birth of the internet<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://tropos.bvn.com.au/2015/03/11/16892/#fn-9813-3" id="fnref-9813-3" onclick="return fdfootnote_show(9813)">3</a></sup>. Their innate qualities have also helped foster the drive of Millennials who have intrinsically come to think outside the box, challenge and question the norm and thus, drive change.

Architectural practice will focus around contemporary cities and our shared spaces, and how we go about implementing these through not only traditional means but new platforms.

Architects will continue to transform urban spaces through playful, political, and participatory interventions, interventions both encouraged and discouraged by policy and power structures. Creative problem solving, use of our cities as an urban laboratories trialling interim studies in the search for longer more substantial change will be frequent. Millennials will seek 21st century solutions to the issues we have been facing since the 18th century. These experimental projects offer new possibilities for occupation, engagement, and development processes within the city on the micro scale, prior to policy induced development<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://tropos.bvn.com.au/2015/03/11/16892/#fn-9813-4" id="fnref-9813-4" onclick="return fdfootnote_show(9813)">4</a></sup>. Projects may originate in new and organic means based on funding and support, a slow conglomeration of resources; both resources of skill and those fiscal.

Guerrilla or grass-roots approaches to design, lead to wider acceptance of new and innovative solutions to larger problems, with power structures able to see strategies implemented as a success, prior to investing extraordinary capital. Ideas such those trialled by raumlaborberlin at Tempelhof in Germany<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://tropos.bvn.com.au/2015/03/11/16892/#fn-9813-5" id="fnref-9813-5" onclick="return fdfootnote_show(9813)">5</a></sup> or Marcus Newbury<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://tropos.bvn.com.au/2015/03/11/16892/#fn-9813-6" id="fnref-9813-6" onclick="return fdfootnote_show(9813)">6</a></sup> of Renew Newcastle fame are prime examples. Raumlabourberlin engaged with citizens of the city, were investing them as “pioneers” to act as agents or stewards for the site<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://tropos.bvn.com.au/2015/03/11/16892/#fn-9813-7" id="fnref-9813-7" onclick="return fdfootnote_show(9813)">7</a></sup> in a series of installations. These exquisite design solutions have led to broader funding and reuse of previously dilapidated spaces. The work of Marcus Newbury investigates combining culture, art and urban planning to stimulate the business economy<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://tropos.bvn.com.au/2015/03/11/16892/#fn-9813-8" id="fnref-9813-8" onclick="return fdfootnote_show(9813)">8</a></sup>. He has since been brought on by Victorian Government to look at similar strategies at the Docklands. These pilots better integrate people and architectural development, inherently allowing for the adoption of successful longer term development. Approaches such as those in Tempelhof in Berlin, or Newcastle, whereby a single architect or person approaches social or political issues with the seed of a design solution, are examples of the need for this generations socially-engaged conscience to utilize their skills in spatial practice to manoeuvre between the scales of the street level and the power structures above.

This individualistic mentality of those power housing the workforce of 2030, makes it logical that those within practice would utilize their skills rather than their cash flow for the greater good. Social consciousness along with open mindedness, a love of travel and experienced based development all plays into how Millennials work and operate. While they are motivated by individual and personal gains, and often accosted by news media for being ‘selfish’; gains can also be local and global with this mentality. A win-win system is implemented. Time may be donated to <em>pro-bono</em> projects in local communities, or expertise offered to larger organised aid faculties. An architect’s expertise in planning, should be utilised in conjunction with government organisation and policy making when considering future cities development. Why is this not yet the case? Being motivated by others perception; still results in good being generated. This mentality of the Millennial collective allows for practice to be about the people, both those working in the field and those who are served by it. Practice driven from the inside rather than by external forces such as time and financial pressure is on the cusp of occurring thanks to the Millenials traits.

<blockquote class="pull">working closely with power structures, collaborating with architects and non-architects alike
{:class="pull"}

While Governments always will have a role in designing and planning from a precinct level, architects will by this stage be better ingrained within planning controls and policy making for current and future development. Practice of 2030, will more than likely have adopted this model of utilizing pioneering ideas such as those mentioned previously as a means for encouraging socially conscious and participative solutions to bigger questions and issues, working closely with power structures, collaborating with architects and non-architects alike.

Bespoke agreements between councils, central governments with consultation from architects, engineers, scientists and economists could be utilized to transform how governments plan and build our cities, as well as fund them. This is something currently being explored in the UK City Deals program. The Cities Policy Unit was created for this purpose in August 2011. It is made up of civil servants and staff seconded from local government, think tanks and the private sector. It works jointly with the Department for Business Innovation and Skills and the Department for Communities and Local Government. These multifaceted policies which branch across various sectors, implemented from above ensure that those best equipped with knowledge, skills and expertise can plan for how public money may best be utilized, take charge of decisions for their local area and create future economic growth<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://tropos.bvn.com.au/2015/03/11/16892/#fn-9813-9" id="fnref-9813-9" onclick="return fdfootnote_show(9813)">9</a></sup>.

We are problem solvers, born and then designed to think critically. We have skills to solve many of the world’s long standing problems and questions with pragmatic and considered answers. In practising using our skills in new and unusual ways we further ourselves, our profession, the lives of others and our practices. It will be those Millenials in the firms of today; currently practicing and learning, who come to define architectural practice of the future. They will do so driven by their collective desire to do good, not simply for themselves, their ego, their Facebook feed or Instagram account–but their inculcated need to help others.

<p>There are lots of great ideas here – I love the ideas of flexibility, chef cooked meals, massages, childcare, gym packages… and pretty much every idea with the exception of (and apologies, its not meant to be a criticism, rather me just sharing my feeling on the topic) a pay scheme based on years of experience. My issues is:</p>
<p>I believe pay should be merit based. Why should someone who isn’t very effective get paid more than someone that is awesome, based purely on age/ relative experience. There is no incentive for people to work hard if their pay is related to years of experience. There is only incentive to go through the motions and not get fired as every year you will be rewarded for merely being here not rewarded for what you’ve contributed in that time. If a young person is talented beyond their years of experience, this should be encouraged and fostered and rewarded and it should be done transparently. </p>
<p>But other than that, bring on paid partner leave and gender equality!</p>

</li>
<li><span class="commenter">Domino Risch</span>
				
<p>Problem is – how do you avoid subjective opinions when considering the relative ‘merits’ of individuals against each other?</p>
<p>Should there be any attempt at an empirical measurement of merit?</p>
<p>Discuss!</p>

</li>
<li><span class="commenter">Adriana Haindl</span>
				
<p>Some really interesting comments above, such as the childcare at work debate, gender equality, and I’m definitely all for chefs, massages and getting a sweet new phone!</p>
<p>However the ideas of “Flexible work from everywhere,” “interactive screens everywhere”, “Video conferencing and chatting availability from anywhere for everyone,” is a concern for me.  Whether these ideas were intended the way I have interpreted them, I think there is a certain importance in the notion of “unplugging” from both technology and others, and having time for one’s own creative reflection and pause.  Many peoples ah ha! moments have happened when there were in isolation and given the opportunity to let their mind wander without interruption. </p>
<p>We live in a digital age where we seek a constant state of connection, either by phone, ipad, email notifications etc, and so it seems we ourselves are already depriving the opportunity for disconnection.  This may be because it is much easier to be connected and distracted from one’s own thoughts, insecurities and self-doubt than to attempt to consider the alternative; isolation and self-reflection.  Additionally our self-esteem can largely be dictated by our interactions and reassurances of others, both digital and non-digital, thus the constant need for connection and external stimulation makes perfect sense.</p>
<p>Workplaces must be mindful in being proactive in creating these “sacred spaces” in an attempt to foster creativity.  A great example of a sacred space at BVN is the hug.  It allows one to move away from external stimuli of the digital age and the physical office to “unplug” and reconfigure ones creative mind. Other ideas might be meditation in the office.  What do you think? Is it important to have constant digital connection or is the value in “unplugging” and reassessing your own creative goals?</p>

</li>
<li><span class="commenter">Stella de Vulder</span>
				
<p>Ah Adriana you understand the VALUE of ALONENESS – as you point out some of our most profound thoughts come when we are alone. You mention the HUG as a place to separate yourself.  It can also be achieved by leaving the studio and either walking across Hyde Park to perambulate your thoughts or sitting in Hyde Park when you feel I just need to think this through – a change of scenery can be a quick and useful technique to find “ALONE” space.</p>

</li>
<li><span class="commenter">Jared Bird</span>
				
<p>These ideas are very attractive.</p>
<p>It seems they are mainly directed towards making work a nicer place to be – or dissolving the boundaries between work and life more, so that we don’t think of what we do as work – which raises questions for me about why work might not be a nice place to be in the first place. Is this the difference between a vocation and an occupation? Between something that we enjoy doing for its own sake, and something that we do out of necessity, where “a worker sells labor and an employer buys it?” ( <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage_labour" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage_labour</a> )</p>
<p>I think work is more enjoyable when I am enjoying the work I am doing. I think the work I am doing can be improved and enriched through the things talked about in the 1:4 idea . . . “week turns into 4 day work 1 day edu / inspire / community.” This is similar to the 80/20 idea talked about in one of the other essays.</p>

<p>Well said Katherine, totally agree.  Basing remuneration on years of experience is fraught with danger and simply unfair.<br />

<p>Totally agree with Katherine – merit based pay is where its at! People should be encouraged to be at their best! (At any stage of their professional development) :)</p>

<p>I’m just going to keep banging the valve drum. Valve has a transparent ‘pay’ system but they’d probably think of it as a ‘reward’ system.</p>
<p>They discuss the value brought to the company by each person in a totally open way. I’d imagine that this <em>could</em> have downsides for introverted or abrasive people but that’s why having objective measures to support the subjective parts is important.</p>
<p>Check out their <a href="http://assets.sbnation.com/assets/1074301/Valve_Handbook_LowRes.pdf" rel="nofollow">new employee handbook</a> and <a href="http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2013/02/varoufakis_on_v.html" rel="nofollow">this podcast with their economist in residence</a>.</p>

<p>I think you have a great point here, but I’m pretty into the idea of choice. I’d like the <em>choice</em><em> to work anywhere, any time. The thing we need to work on in parallel to giving people choice </em><em>to</em> work is giving them the choice <em>not</em> to work too!</p>
<p>Without sounding like a stuck record reading <a href="http://blogs.bvn.com.au/tropos/2014/08/12/remote/" title="Remote" rel="nofollow">Remote </a>would be a good idea for these sorts of issues.</p>
<p>The sanctity of time not spent ‘doing’ needs to be recognised. We don’t think nearly enough because thinking is intangible, and therefore low status. Our only way of making ourselves seem important is through doing, and doing leads to less thinking, which leads to poorer quality doing.</p>
<blockquote><p>If I had eight hours to chop down a tree, I’d spend six hours sharpening my ax[e]</p></blockquote>

<li><span class="commenter">Ben Doherty</span>
				
<p>The <a href="http://blogs.bvn.com.au/tropos/2015/02/25/31130-645pm-dear-diary/" rel="nofollow">Dear Diary</a> author talks about this too. </p>
<blockquote><p>every so often I like to get away on my own, just to see if my sanity can stand time without distractions. If I listen to the voices in my head are they saying anything good?</p></blockquote>
<p>I think that as genuinely ubiquitous connection becomes a reality (<a href="http://www.google.com/loon/" rel="nofollow">Loon</a> and <a href="http://nextbigfuture.com/2015/01/elon-musk-plans-for-4000-toaster-sized.html" rel="nofollow">Toasters</a>) we are likely to sanction areas a connection blackspots (with emergency services exemptions). Downtime is likely to be enforced through something like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachograph" rel="nofollow">truck driver’s tachograph</a> (again, with exemptions for creative bursts!)</p>
<p>Stella, I’m not sure it’s aloneness that’s necessarily important, but more like interpretability. Muck of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Kahneman" rel="nofollow">Kahneman</a> &amp; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amos_Tversky" rel="nofollow">Tverski</a>‘s important work was done on <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/~kahneman/docs/attention_and_effort/Attention_lo_quality.pdf" title="15mb pdf" rel="nofollow">afternoon walks</a>.</p>
<p>As I’ve banged on about before, I think that it’s all about giving oneself the choice to be in the state that suits us best at any given time. (For a given desired outcome.)

                    <h2 class="title">Synthesis</h2>
                    <p>In thinking about what an architectural office of the future may look like in 2030 I’ve first had a look back 15 years at the architectural office of the 90’s and how things have changed, from the skivvy, bow tie wearing days. When drawing boards still occupied at least half the office, digital cameras were the size of phone books, faxes where the standard form of communication and 3D Rendering was a bespoke highly expensive luxury.</p>
<p>Those days saw the emergence of technology in computers and software as the driving force behind how we produced architecture. In the intervening years that growth has accelerated with increasing speed. New ways of doing things enter our landscape, first as occasional methods and then becoming mainstream. Sketchup Rhino, Grasshopper are the evolution of AutoCAD and Microstation. At the time these were viewed with the same aura of eagerness and potential that each new software package presents today.</p>
<p>As architects we have always had the role of translating ideas into visual and hopefully built form. Increasingly as technology evolves we have been able to use this to develop the tools to lead the conversation. As the tools become more sophisticated they are then directly able to go from design to production. Already the use of 3d printers is becoming mainstream. A world where what we draw is directly connected to machines which not only manufacture components but assemble and construct them together is not far away.<br />
The speed of technology growth in the next 15 years will no doubt continue. As will our ability to communicate with clients at an ever increasing level of reality. As architects we should look to what opportunities this presents to reengage as thought leaders in the 2030 practice of the future.</p>
<p>In 2000 the role of the architect and their place within the how of building creation had become subjugated to project managers. Working under them as just another expendable consultant. As a profession we had let ourselves give up the ground as project leaders, developed over many decades, and let it pass onto others.<br />
In comparison to where we sit today and what opportunity this has for the architectural office of 2030, it would suggest that the tide has started to turn. Whilst it still the norm that buildings must be, on time, on budget and more often than not iconic; we are starting to see an appreciation of the role that architects can have. Not just in the role as a designer but as the motivator and thought protagonist leading to the generation of better ideas and solutions.</p>
<p>Increasingly this role is not in isolation, as in the past, but working together with others. The power of the collective is becoming increasingly apparent. In so doing we are creating an ability to blur the lines in what we do. In some ways our skills are akin to that of traditional heroes like Buckminster Fuller. In 1963 he described the role of the architect as a</p>
<blockquote><p>“Synthesis of artist, inventor, mechanic, objective economist and evolutionary strategist”</p></blockquote>
<p>The difference in the future will be the diversity of this role being seen in the development of skills as generalists. We would not necessarily be masters of each of these areas; dictating how things should occur. The architect of 2030 could be described as more akin to a professional conductor. They would have an appreciation of what different people bring to the table—and an ability to bring these together with their own. In this model the traditional line of responsibilities are blurred. There are opportunities for a number of voices at the table each contributing and participating in the final outcome.</p>
<p>This blurring of lines and responsibilities will lead to tremendous opportunity for the practice of the future. With the coming together of architects with other professions and roles. In this vision of a 2030 architectural studio, the space is one that houses many different people and provides the common infrastructure for their needs. Reception, tea spaces and meeting rooms are all shared. We have started to see this occur in some of our own work in BVN and worldwide at institutions like the HUB Westminster in London. There, within a single environment you have a multitude of professions. A night school, magazine headquarters, startup spaces, graphic designers, architects and environmental scientists; all sharing the same workplace. People within these spaces are not typically working on the same projects but they are finding that engaging with each other in the same space offers the opportunity to create a symbiotic transfer of ideas and knowledge. Each group building from the next to create the solution or generate the spark of an idea for their particular project.</p>

<p>To begin with it seemed as if this was another moan about how project management is eating our dinner. By the end I think it’s more optimistic.</p>
<p>At the risk of asking too many questions in this comment:<br />
* Do people think that overall project quality has diminished with the rise in importance of project managers?<br />
* Is that too simplistic a question?<br />
* Maybe projects have got better on a set of dimensions that matter to clients but not along dimensions that matter to architects?</p>
<p>It feels like the idea of this is that we reframe our offering to concentrate on what we do best. I like the analogy with a conductor. (Although I think others will hate it!) Taken to its ultimate conclusion it feels as if this fits well with the <a href="http://blogs.bvn.com.au/tropos/2015/02/15/fluid-tiling/" rel="nofollow">Fluid Tiling</a> essay. The conductor needn’t be able to play each instrument, just be able to make sure the the specific experts play well together.</p>
<p>I’d imagine that the idea of “letting go” of more areas of expertise will upset people, but it feels more like reframing what we do to exclude the bits we don’t want to do and include more of the bits that we do.</p>
<p>I’d be interested to hear what peoples’ thoughts on where that frame might lie!</p>

<p>I don’t think demonizing PM’s leads to a very happy life….<br />
In my experience, I’ve seen the good, the bad and the downright pathetic ends of the PM spectrum.<br />
The reality of most of what they do is stuff that we don’t want to do anyway eg take the minutes and yell at the underperforming consultants.<br />
I think that we need to stop thinking of them and our clients (who also come in good and bad variations!) as a problem.  We need to find more sophisticated ways of working with them – and along the way improving our own attitudes and biases and leading by example.  I’d love to see a future where PM’s and CM’s are co-collaborators with us.  For example, on Minters we have had a seriously fast track program, and with the help of the Construction Managers (who were engaged very early and at the same time as the Project Managers) we have been able to find ways to design and build things that without that cooperation and understanding between all the parties including our client would not have been possible.<br />
It all comes back to relationships.</p>
</li>					
<li><span class="commenter">Bill Dowzer</span>
				
<p>I tend to agree with Peter’s comments, not waging in on the PM debate, enough said there. I think there is a space to explore in the independent micro players collaborating as a way of practicing in the future. We are seeing the rise of the individual as a powerful position choosing projects rather than practices to be involved in. An interesting possibility is what future places can be designed to house these collectives and promote engagement.</p>
<p>Is the mid size practice (of which we probably are) destined to die? Do you need to be the one stop shop or the collective?</p>

<p>“As a profession we had let ourselves give up the ground as project leaders, developed over many decades, and let it pass onto others.”</p>
<p>That’s an astute observation, and I think the method of looking backward to look forward has merit but for it to be truly effective you would really need to explore in detail the historical context for why Architects supposedly abdicated this PM role in the late 20th Century in the first place*.<br />
This argument is always framed as ‘we dropped the ball as a profession’ which may be partly true, but it’s much more complex and interesting than that. Consider for instance the following 2 factors at play – </p>
<p>•	At the height of postmodernism, Architects specifically rejected the role of contract admin and similar ‘clerkitect’ aspects of the profession (rather have it ‘taken from them’) in favour of solving the ‘problem’ of the failed modernist project instead (which in the wake of many  failed building projects they saw being resolved by discussion, theory and ‘Paper Architecture’ in the first instance rather than in built form)<br />
•	After the end of World War 2 the established and highly organized military industrial complex needed to something else to do, and large scale building/rebuilding (which the War itself actually contributed toward the necessity for) was a natural fit for these highly skilled and newly unemployed professionals to take up. Its no coincidence that the first wave for professional PMs in the 50s and 60s were actually ex-army. There was no way the Architectural profession could compete in this space.</p>
<p>Imagining where we should be or want to be (conductor/co-collaborater, whatever) is fine, but I would like to know what similar forces/conditions (economic/geo-political etc) like those described above are at work currently that will ‘force our hand’ as a profession in deciding ‘what we do’</p>
<p>*Also worth acknowledging the many Archs who buck the trend and still deliver lump sum contracts and offer a full service (even on a large scale). what value are they offering to their clients that PMS aren’t?</p>
</li>					
<li><span class="commenter">Peter Titmuss</span>
				
<p>Agree – takes too much energy to continue fighting the PM/Architect war.</p>
<p>I don’t think the profession abdicated its role of ‘project leader’ (for which I suspect is interpreted as ‘project visionary’) as much as the idea of a heroic ‘project visionary’, for a host of reasons, became obsolete/ambiguous/polyvalent.. not one voice as much as the synthesis of many.</p>
<p>Interesting to understand whether this vision of the future brings the various  (now separate) players together as a single one-stop-shop conglomerate or calls for more specialisation – independent micro players who can collaborate with any other at a moment’s notice….

                    <h2 class="title">The Architects’ Manifesto</h2>
                    <h2>The Year 2050:</h2>
<p>In 2049 the last 100 architects in Australia adopted “The Architects’ Manifesto” following the decimation of the architecture profession through market predation led by massive companies including Lend Lease, AECOM and CBRE, who took over the roles of designing and documenting buildings from a profession that had become too feeble to fight back.</p>
<p>The aim of the Architects Manifesto is to involve every architect in the development of a vibrant and compelling architecture culture in their community.</p>
<p>This is seen as being the only way that the value of architecture will be realized and will be able to stand on its own as vital to the community’s well-being as medicine, law, science and the fine arts.</p>
<div class="manifesto">
<h1>The Architects Manifesto:</h1>
<ol>
<li>All architects must develop communication skills</li>
<li>All architecture talks must be developed for public consumption</li>
<li>All architecture associations, institutes and such like must have membership open to the public</li>
<li>All architecture processes must be filmed and broadcast online</li>
<li>All architecture websites must include the latest films on the latest projects</li>
<li>All architects must give at least one public talk each year</li>
<li>All architects must seek opportunities to talk to news media about issues concerning the built environment</li>
<li>All architects must initiate at least one event in their local community each year, this may be: a tour of local architecture, an exhibition, a film showing, or something even more compelling</li>
<li>All architects must visit their local schools and put on an architectural event for the students once a year</li>
<li>All architecture awards results must be announced in the general media and online and the winners are required to explain their award winning projects to as many people as possible, preferably on a national television programme. Any winner who does not comply with this directive will have their award withdrawn, as without communication, the award is useless.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The architecture office of the future will need to have communication embedded in its business DNA. Only by ensuring that all architects are engaged in a broad and active communication programme will architecture be valued and sought after by those seeking to improve the built environment.</p>

					
<ol>
	<li><span class="commenter">Ben Doherty</span>
				
			<p>I’d love to see this happen. So much of what we currently pass off as ‘communication’ is really words used as a weapon to confuse people.</p>
<p>I actually like all the ‘must’s in here. I’d imagine that a lot of people think “that sounds like too much work, I’m too busy to do that”. If we really did do all these things then the monetary value of projects would go up as the public starts to see the value that we–privately–gripe about them not seeing. That would mean that each person would need to do less work to maintain a similar lifestyle. </p>
<p>With people doing less work for more money there would be space for more people to do the job. We’d need this as we attracted more young bright things through all the visibility we’d generated!

                    <h2 class="title">The Cusp</h2>
                    <p>Architecture is on the cusp of commodification as never before!</p>
<p>The architecture practice of the future is likely more a broad coalition of people dealing with the multitude of experiential aspects of habitat. That could include businesses and people involved in digital media through to more traditional delivery of large building models focussed on a collaborative delivery methodology.</p>
<p>Whilst it is a current cliché, collaboration is the currency of the future—it assumes a collective aspiration that the solutions to opportunities, issues and problems are best found through multiple and diverse minds acting both randomly and cohesively.</p>
<p>For architecture this requires a diminution of control of certain aspects of projects and being receptive to a multitude of inputs and potential solutions to matters that were once the domain of the architect. For example, the potential to print buildings or components challenges a range of conventions not the least being the traditional notion of structure and fabric and the things that are commonly within the custodianship of the architect—consider the effect of print technology on the architectural narrative; from the deterministic nature of architectural theory or ideology to the opportunistic and innovative nature of technology.</p>
<p>It will be the task of architects to retain the important issues pertaining to habitat—equality, dignity, urbanity, inclusiveness, generosity, respect, public engagement etc. After all, these are the historical manoeuvres in city building and human habitat that have created the extraordinary built world.</p>
<blockquote class="pull"><p>Capital and risk is everything and will become more so at the expense of creativity, innovation and intellectualism.</p></blockquote>
<p>The tendency for organisations to offer complete service from design to delivery is clear—in the 1960s Lend Lease in Australia diminished the architect’s role by the introduction of holistic project delivery with design/construct and project management. The coming era of building is likely to be far reaching in respect of the architect’s role in the delivery of buildings. And this will not just be the preserve of the development industry, as we are already seeing governments contracting to builders and developers to provide complete services as a mandatory process. Capital and risk is everything and will become more so at the expense of creativity, innovation and intellectualism.</p>
<blockquote class="pull"><p>there will always be the place for bespoke buildings</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, there will always be the place for bespoke buildings from important public projects through to the house. And this is an essential component of a new practice—being nimble enough and diverse enough to provide a range of services with methodologies independent from each other and clever enough to be competitive in all—cost structures will need to be flexible enough to react to varying financial contexts: one price cannot fit all.</p>
<p>The other aspect of vital change is the structure of the future organisation. If these businesses are multi-faceted, organic and collaborative depending on the task, collective in decision making and agile to enable economic growth and profitability then the fundamental supporting structures of these entities need to change.</p>
<blockquote class="pull"><p>the need to embrace …&nbsp;“otherness” requires a new flexible model.</p></blockquote>
<p>Rather than a structured, shareholder owned company based on capital investment, a more progressive model is required—an entity based on diversity, merit, task, process and outcome. Whilst the twentieth century model of architectural practice has served us well—hierarchical practice in a defined and (until now) contained profession collaborating with complementary building professionals and the construction industry, the need to embrace other interests, disciplines, creative industries and “otherness” requires a new flexible model.</p>
<blockquote class="pull"><p>This is a culture based on generosity of intellectual speculation</p></blockquote>
<p>The model for a new organisation is a meritocracy—one based on a person’s or a group’s abilities, interests, motivation, energy and contribution. A model that allows for interaction with other groups and diverse partners—a collaborative culture seeking equitable profitable outcomes for all participants for creative and technical excellence. Models of remuneration need to change—sharing risk and return, sharing funding, sharing profit and return, new ways of revenue raising and project investment and sharing intellectual capital. This is a culture based on generosity of intellectual speculation resulting in equitable profitable financial return in a realm of creative and technical innovation and excellence.</p>
<p>The age of containment is diminishing and the age of possibilities is about to proliferate—engagement and sharing is beginning to bring about a new work culture; different from a culture of professional segregation and partition. The nearest current model of a meritocracy is a trust or foundation which exists to engage in excellence and innovation both technically and creatively without the shackles of traditional individual ownership—community responsibility for community return. Profit is absolutely fundamental to any organisation and must underpin any business model, the drivers for a more democratic and sharing culture will also be participation, process and outcome.</p>
<blockquote class="pull"><p>a “guild” might be an appropriate model</p></blockquote>
<p>Historically a “guild” might be an appropriate model—an organisation in which like-minded crafts people came together to share their work, to engage in cross-fertilization, to create equitable wealth through industry and most importantly to create a collective and collaborative culture—a vehicle for creativity, as distinct from a vehicle for control which describes many contemporary businesses.</p>
<p>Think also of the Bauhaus as a model of similar aspiration—total immersion in the creative world with shared return—a great experiment in the making of a creative profitable community—its products, its design, art movements, architecture, it’s intellectual influence, its reputation and its inspiration just as strong now as then; it’s a pity the National Socialists got in the way.</p>
<p>Is this possible?…………absolutely!</p>
<p>BVN’s current structure is one of shareholding as a model of determination, and Arup is one of merit, industry and creativity as a model of determination. A small shift in BVN’s organizational model from shareholding entity to trust or foundation could create the space for a new creative, inclusive, diverse and participative cultural community to evolve.</p>

	<p>I’ve really enjoyed this essay – it’s fascinating and really important to consider the structure of our business at the same time that we consider our craft – the two absolutely go hand in hand.</p>
	</li>
						
	<li><span class="commenter">Ben Doherty</span>
	<p>It’s interesting joining up the essays, seeing what’s common between them.</p>
	<p>One theme that seems to come up a few times is the idea that we’ll be “<em>a broad coalition of people</em>” dealing with “<em>experiential aspects of habitat</em>“. These both come up in <a title="31/1/30 6:45pm - Dear Diary," href="http://blogs.bvn.com.au/tropos/2015/03/02/31130-645pm-dear-diary/" rel="nofollow">Dear diary</a> and in <a title="‘PIM’ and the Living Lab" href="http://blogs.bvn.com.au/tropos/2015/03/02/pim-and-the-living-lab/" rel="nofollow">PIM</a>.<br />
	I wonder if Semper were writing his odd essays about carpets these days would he finally have something of value to say about how we’re really only designing the experience of being in the building–everything else is contributing to that. It’s user experience design, but of physical space, not app-space.</p>
	<p>The idea of collaboration being a cliché made me wonder if there is a cliché life-cycle? Things are ideas, then once everyone knows about them talking about them is a cliché, but eventually it becomes so ingrained that it’s not even thought about.</p>
	<p>The idea you bring up of “diminution” sounds like you are telling people that they need to let go. I’d agree. It feels as if we want to hang on to whatever we have left of the traditional profession. <a href="http://blogs.bvn.com.au/tropos/2015/02/25/dont-worry-there-will-be-an-aootf-and-it-wont-be-in-a-vat-of-brain-juice/#comment-3249" rel="nofollow">Domino’s comment</a> the other day said something similar about letting go. What are the parts of this job that we’d really like to keep? My guess is that if you asked 10 people you’d get at least 11 answers. Maybe it is time to split up, let go of the title Architect, and just be engaged in the enterprise of architecture (whatever that means)? (This is well explained in <a title="FLUID TILING" href="http://blogs.bvn.com.au/tropos/2015/03/02/fluid-tiling/" rel="nofollow">Fluid Tiling</a>.) I don’t think that there is any shame in that at all! Philosophy split into moral philosophy and natural philosophy (which became science), and I doubt either branch feels diminished for it.</p>
	<p>I disagree that&nbsp;“Capital and risk is everything and will become more so at the expense of creativity, innovation and intellectualism”. Capital and risk are powerful levers, but if we’re willing to roll over and let go of “creativity, innovation and intellectualism” then that’s just laziness. We need to find a way to demonstrate the value that is created through producing those things. The argument&nbsp;that we need to compete on more than just cost seem to be a bit earlier in the&nbsp;cliché life-cycle.</p>
	<p>I’m really interested in how we’d transfer to a meritocracy. In my mind meritocracy, risk-sharing etc. requires significantly more transparency than we currently have. I can see why we’d want to keep lots of information close, it’s a certain way of doing business–I disagree with it, but that doesn’t make it wrong. In a system where people are making decisions for themselves we’d need to give them enough information to make good choices. Especially so that they didn’t feel like they had been worked over by the system. (See my <a href="http://blogs.bvn.com.au/tropos/2014/08/12/remote/" rel="nofollow">remote review</a> and other rants to this effect.)</p>

                    <p>Following the national studio meeting and LEAN workshop, my focus was on what the architecture / design profession sells, what sets it apart from other professions and professionals, defining this and considering a possibility of what an AOOTF could be based on this…</p>

We sell our imagination; we practice creativity

<li>Scope – what does this look like?

Just as a construction site is our office, our AOOTF could not resemble a traditional office as we know it. For example, if you don’t count the builder’s site office, there are no desks on a construction site.


{% picture essays/construction-site_2.jpg alt="essays/construction-site_2.jpg" title="" %}


Do we need to reflect a corporate conservatism at all? Why? Our profession is inherently based on creativity. Is it a less orchestrated space? Can we have a meeting on the floor or leaning against a wall?

The AOOTF could enable ourselves to go to work to investigate, create, play, perfect, learn and admire every day when you feel the need to.</li>
<li>How could this AOOTF operate?

Foster spontaneity with ‘bump’ / chance meetings with other colleagues to expand the richness and quality of our collective imagination. Nurture ‘core’ purpose. At all hours?

<p>Does it fall under the banner of BVN, not necessarily under the BVN brand? Can it be trialled within the current studio as a secondment?

Do we hold classes and invite external / community participation and learning?</p>

<ol>

<li><span class="commenter">Simon Swain</span>
<p>I totally support this idea of a culture and environment that nutures creativity and enables experiments.
</p>
</li>

<li><span class="commenter">Glenn Irwin</span>
<p>Excellent! Lets do it.</p>
<p>I tend to always fall back to the vision of designing, attending meetings and all the other tasks being within a projected workshop environment or wearing an occulus like apparatus. Everything is recorded real time, no need to write or sketch everything into a formal document. Its simply compiled and filtered over time and fashioned into the brand. The technology tracks progress and manages all forms of information. This allows more time to test and develop the creative aspects. </p>
<p>Question: Given the small percentage of design and creativity that occurs in the current day process and that many Architectural roles rely on being more the communicators, recorders and facilitators, will there be the room or demand for all of us to foster a purely creative and imaginative position?</p>
<p>Like the industrial age and information age has eliminated a lot of people skilled processes, I think the answer lies in recognising that the skills always require a paradigm shift to survive. Thus far, as a practice, it has.
</p>
</li>

<li><span class="commenter">Glenn Irwin</span>
<p>I’d imagine thered be some kind of critical mass for it to continue. I’m sure theres a study somewhere.
</p>
</li>

<li><span class="commenter">Simon Swain</span>
<p>To this  “will there be the room or demand for all of us to foster a purely creative and imaginative position?”</p>
<p>I believe that it depends on collective priorities and how we reconfigure and enable ourselves. For example DHers are familar with design(close to the ‘imaginative’) permiating most facets of practice. Including the mundane ones. This results in the majority of actions and communications being strategic to enable something. Lests say in this regard maybe it was for the best architectural or design outcome. This is was a focus and everyone got in behind this.</p>
<p>We could reinterrogate this idea by saying – Is everyone currently getting in behind and supporting a collective focus for the future at BVN? Is focus or purpose required. Does everyone need to care? or can this work with only a minority?</p>
<p>If the collective wanted imagniation (or other) to be the priorty then whats stopping us?

## CONSIDER BVN 2030 AS AN ANALOGY OF A SUCCESSFUL SCIENCE MUSEUM

### A POTENTIAL STUDIO MODEL…

{% picture essays/fy_Page_10.png alt="" title="" %}

{% picture essays/fy_Page_11.png alt="" title="" %}

* Technology will be at a point where we can collaborate effectively, immediately and meaningfully in teams / projects regardless of our location.
* Practice is global with strategically located ‘Flagship’ studios, and other studios around the world where we have projects (either independently or in collaboration with local practices) of varying scales.
* A Flagship studio indicates the presence of the range of diverse roles. They are not necessarily large scale however have great presence in the city which they are located, attract large numbers of the public to the educational and cultural program, and project types within these studios generally represent the whole body of work of our practice. Other studios varying from ‘stand-alone’ to ‘shared’ have reduced diversity in staffing and tend to more traditional architectural roles. Other studios may evolve to become Flagship studios.
* All staff who work at any of the BVN studios have experienced working within one or more of the flagship studios. They are initiated through operational, educational and team-building programs. Through these experiences they develop an understanding of BVN culture, the work ethos and meet a wide variety of staff whom they will collaborate with in future projects regardless of which studio they end up in.
* Project teams are not determined by location but by skill-set, individual development goals and availability. Team boundaries are fluid—people can belong to more than one team. Teams can include members from different parts of the world in different time zones.
* There is greater scope for workplace flexibility. For example someone based in Sydney might work early in the morning with their NZ-based team, have the day free and then continue working in the evening with a team in Hong Kong. This will enable greater numbers of parents to work around family commitments and return to the workforce.
* All staff have the option to work part-time (4 days) to pursue other architectural related interests. For example, tutoring, personal study/projects. Given that a greater number of people work less hours, there needs to be a greater body of staff members to draw upon in relation to the number of projects being undertaken. This does not necessarily mean that BVN becomes larger in scale (we may choose to be more selective and undertake less projects).
* The skill base and project aspirations of each individual staff member are widely shared and known amongst the organisation. Communication and collaboration skills are paramount for team members to work successfully in flexible and virtual contexts across time zones.
* Staff members include people from other sectors to provide first hand input into project-types. For example, there are educators, health and sport professionals who are at the forefront of thinking in their professions and who act as consultants throughout the practice and contribute to research.
* Teams involved in R&amp;D, education, public programs and marketing are also global in nature. The work of these teams draw a wide audience to BVN’s studios or website through exhibitions, forums, talks, films, school programs, papers etc. that are attractive to and involve the general public, not just other architects. Partnerships around these offering are developed between schools, universities, cultural institutions and other practitioners and businesses.
* Staff traditionally only associated with the activities of architectural teams actively engage and are involved with inputs and outputs from these teams. Outputs are shared widely throughout the practice through varying formats, in person, physically through installation, and virtually.
* R&amp;D outputs are varied. They can be written in the form of papers which can be presented at conferences. They can also be physical, whether as an exhibition or travelling exhibition.

* Ben Doherty
	
	I really like this idea. When I was at uni we often talked about what our studio would be like when we were real architects. Mine was 4 shop units that housed a bakery, a cafe, a model making studio and a bookshop, and then the studio would be along the back. (Imagine a 4 pronged E.) Thinking back on it we probably wouldn’t have actually needed any dedicated studio space. Anyway, the street frontage idea appeals to me. Given my obvious bias I’m going to make some observations and ask some questions.
	
	There is an assumption that having more women able to practice is a good thing. I agree that it is, but I’m not sure if it has ever been proven beyond anecdotally that it’s a good thing. This feels similar to be various rants about architects not being explicit about value. What benefit does the shopfront model have when it comes to improving equality? Is that just a general aspiration?
	
	The definitions are interesting, but it feels backwards to define ourselves with reference to them. The dictionary’s job is to report on the state of the world, and if we choose to drift–or change completely–the definition then it’s our prerogative.
	
	The section on stages is really interesting. A lot of the discussion in DADB revolve around this extension. I wonder if it’s time to let go of the middle though? on the first diagram (1-5) you identify that we aren’t really trained to do 3-5, and that it’s unlikely that we’ll be able to generate much value there in the future. (I know we sometimes make a lot of profit documenting, but I doubt that we’ll continue to do so if lower cost options emerge.) I’d be interested to see what would happen in the second scenario (0-7). It feels like sections 0-3 are much less susceptible to process optimisation that will lead to competition on fee. Lots of documentation can be offloaded onto computer-intelligence (think Revit drawing sections) or onto low cost staff in other countries. Sections 1-3 and 7 (winning work, Briefing, Concept design, detailed design, negotiating with councils and then ultimately Post occupancy analysis) all require physical presence and is much less automatable.
	
	Street frontage has done amazing things for Apple’s bottom line. It’s one of the things that has changed them from a company that sells computers like Dell or IBM into a company that sells lifestyles. People are willing to pay a lot more for a lifestyle than for some silicon and plastic. Apple’s shops aren’t just places to see ‘things’. Their lecture space, and actually most of the rest of their space is about selling that lifestyle. Maybe that’s what this museum idea would do for our industry?
	
* Luke Chalmers
	
	As I went through this one, I found myself considering more, the branding of architecture, similar to what Ben says about Apple and the street frontage. What if BVN became a brand, an architectural brand. In the same way Apple is to technology?
	
* Jared Bird
	
	This is really interesting.
	
	In the diagram that compares architectural practice to science museums, all of the different aspects of the practice (public programs, R&amp;D, marketing) have been drawn at the same size. I wonder how it would look if they were drawn at different sizes to represent how much of the practice’s resources they each utilize. How much time would actually be spent producing architecture? What would it mean if it was less than the other activities? I think that would be ok.
	
	It seems this idea would only work in a very large organisation.
	
	It seems like a lot of the activities described (the promotion of architecture, helping the public understand what we do) are currently being provided by other organisations – universities or the AIA, for example. What are the benefits of private companies taking on this activity? Maybe we could take on some of the other roles these (para-industry?) groups traditionally provide. Maybe we could set up a boutique university or research centre that offers international scholarships. Maybe we could become a publisher responsible for a world-wide architecture journal. Or something . . .
