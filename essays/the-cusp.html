    <p>Architecture is on the cusp of commodification as never before!</p>
<p>The architecture practice of the future is likely more a broad coalition of people dealing with the multitude of experiential aspects of habitat. That could include businesses and people involved in digital media through to more traditional delivery of large building models focussed on a collaborative delivery methodology.</p>
<p>Whilst it is a current cliché, collaboration is the currency of the future—it assumes a collective aspiration that the solutions to opportunities, issues and problems are best found through multiple and diverse minds acting both randomly and cohesively.</p>
<p>For architecture this requires a diminution of control of certain aspects of projects and being receptive to a multitude of inputs and potential solutions to matters that were once the domain of the architect. For example, the potential to print buildings or components challenges a range of conventions not the least being the traditional notion of structure and fabric and the things that are commonly within the custodianship of the architect—consider the effect of print technology on the architectural narrative; from the deterministic nature of architectural theory or ideology to the opportunistic and innovative nature of technology.</p>
<p>It will be the task of architects to retain the important issues pertaining to habitat—equality, dignity, urbanity, inclusiveness, generosity, respect, public engagement etc. After all, these are the historical manoeuvres in city building and human habitat that have created the extraordinary built world.</p>
<blockquote class="pull"><p>Capital and risk is everything and will become more so at the expense of creativity, innovation and intellectualism.</p></blockquote>
<p>The tendency for organisations to offer complete service from design to delivery is clear—in the 1960s Lend Lease in Australia diminished the architect’s role by the introduction of holistic project delivery with design/construct and project management. The coming era of building is likely to be far reaching in respect of the architect’s role in the delivery of buildings. And this will not just be the preserve of the development industry, as we are already seeing governments contracting to builders and developers to provide complete services as a mandatory process. Capital and risk is everything and will become more so at the expense of creativity, innovation and intellectualism.</p>
<blockquote class="pull"><p>there will always be the place for bespoke buildings</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, there will always be the place for bespoke buildings from important public projects through to the house. And this is an essential component of a new practice—being nimble enough and diverse enough to provide a range of services with methodologies independent from each other and clever enough to be competitive in all—cost structures will need to be flexible enough to react to varying financial contexts: one price cannot fit all.</p>
<p>The other aspect of vital change is the structure of the future organisation. If these businesses are multi-faceted, organic and collaborative depending on the task, collective in decision making and agile to enable economic growth and profitability then the fundamental supporting structures of these entities need to change.</p>
<blockquote class="pull"><p>the need to embrace …&nbsp;“otherness” requires a new flexible model.</p></blockquote>
<p>Rather than a structured, shareholder owned company based on capital investment, a more progressive model is required—an entity based on diversity, merit, task, process and outcome. Whilst the twentieth century model of architectural practice has served us well—hierarchical practice in a defined and (until now) contained profession collaborating with complementary building professionals and the construction industry, the need to embrace other interests, disciplines, creative industries and “otherness” requires a new flexible model.</p>
<blockquote class="pull"><p>This is a culture based on generosity of intellectual speculation</p></blockquote>
<p>The model for a new organisation is a meritocracy—one based on a person’s or a group’s abilities, interests, motivation, energy and contribution. A model that allows for interaction with other groups and diverse partners—a collaborative culture seeking equitable profitable outcomes for all participants for creative and technical excellence. Models of remuneration need to change—sharing risk and return, sharing funding, sharing profit and return, new ways of revenue raising and project investment and sharing intellectual capital. This is a culture based on generosity of intellectual speculation resulting in equitable profitable financial return in a realm of creative and technical innovation and excellence.</p>
<p>The age of containment is diminishing and the age of possibilities is about to proliferate—engagement and sharing is beginning to bring about a new work culture; different from a culture of professional segregation and partition. The nearest current model of a meritocracy is a trust or foundation which exists to engage in excellence and innovation both technically and creatively without the shackles of traditional individual ownership—community responsibility for community return. Profit is absolutely fundamental to any organisation and must underpin any business model, the drivers for a more democratic and sharing culture will also be participation, process and outcome.</p>
<blockquote class="pull"><p>a “guild” might be an appropriate model</p></blockquote>
<p>Historically a “guild” might be an appropriate model—an organisation in which like-minded crafts people came together to share their work, to engage in cross-fertilization, to create equitable wealth through industry and most importantly to create a collective and collaborative culture—a vehicle for creativity, as distinct from a vehicle for control which describes many contemporary businesses.</p>
<p>Think also of the Bauhaus as a model of similar aspiration—total immersion in the creative world with shared return—a great experiment in the making of a creative profitable community—its products, its design, art movements, architecture, it’s intellectual influence, its reputation and its inspiration just as strong now as then; it’s a pity the National Socialists got in the way.</p>
<p>Is this possible?…………absolutely!</p>
<p>BVN’s current structure is one of shareholding as a model of determination, and Arup is one of merit, industry and creativity as a model of determination. A small shift in BVN’s organizational model from shareholding entity to trust or foundation could create the space for a new creative, inclusive, diverse and participative cultural community to evolve.</p>

	<p>I’ve really enjoyed this essay – it’s fascinating and really important to consider the structure of our business at the same time that we consider our craft – the two absolutely go hand in hand.</p>
	</li>
						
	<li><span class="commenter">Ben Doherty</span>
	<p>It’s interesting joining up the essays, seeing what’s common between them.</p>
	<p>One theme that seems to come up a few times is the idea that we’ll be “<em>a broad coalition of people</em>” dealing with “<em>experiential aspects of habitat</em>“. These both come up in <a title="31/1/30 6:45pm - Dear Diary," href="http://blogs.bvn.com.au/tropos/2015/03/02/31130-645pm-dear-diary/" rel="nofollow">Dear diary</a> and in <a title="‘PIM’ and the Living Lab" href="http://blogs.bvn.com.au/tropos/2015/03/02/pim-and-the-living-lab/" rel="nofollow">PIM</a>.<br />
	I wonder if Semper were writing his odd essays about carpets these days would he finally have something of value to say about how we’re really only designing the experience of being in the building–everything else is contributing to that. It’s user experience design, but of physical space, not app-space.</p>
	<p>The idea of collaboration being a cliché made me wonder if there is a cliché life-cycle? Things are ideas, then once everyone knows about them talking about them is a cliché, but eventually it becomes so ingrained that it’s not even thought about.</p>
	<p>The idea you bring up of “diminution” sounds like you are telling people that they need to let go. I’d agree. It feels as if we want to hang on to whatever we have left of the traditional profession. <a href="http://blogs.bvn.com.au/tropos/2015/02/25/dont-worry-there-will-be-an-aootf-and-it-wont-be-in-a-vat-of-brain-juice/#comment-3249" rel="nofollow">Domino’s comment</a> the other day said something similar about letting go. What are the parts of this job that we’d really like to keep? My guess is that if you asked 10 people you’d get at least 11 answers. Maybe it is time to split up, let go of the title Architect, and just be engaged in the enterprise of architecture (whatever that means)? (This is well explained in <a title="FLUID TILING" href="http://blogs.bvn.com.au/tropos/2015/03/02/fluid-tiling/" rel="nofollow">Fluid Tiling</a>.) I don’t think that there is any shame in that at all! Philosophy split into moral philosophy and natural philosophy (which became science), and I doubt either branch feels diminished for it.</p>
	<p>I disagree that&nbsp;“Capital and risk is everything and will become more so at the expense of creativity, innovation and intellectualism”. Capital and risk are powerful levers, but if we’re willing to roll over and let go of “creativity, innovation and intellectualism” then that’s just laziness. We need to find a way to demonstrate the value that is created through producing those things. The argument&nbsp;that we need to compete on more than just cost seem to be a bit earlier in the&nbsp;cliché life-cycle.</p>
	<p>I’m really interested in how we’d transfer to a meritocracy. In my mind meritocracy, risk-sharing etc. requires significantly more transparency than we currently have. I can see why we’d want to keep lots of information close, it’s a certain way of doing business–I disagree with it, but that doesn’t make it wrong. In a system where people are making decisions for themselves we’d need to give them enough information to make good choices. Especially so that they didn’t feel like they had been worked over by the system. (See my <a href="http://blogs.bvn.com.au/tropos/2014/08/12/remote/" rel="nofollow">remote review</a> and other rants to this effect.)</p>
