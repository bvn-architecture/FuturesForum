    <p>The ongoing growth of the architectural profession in line with the current direction of technology will drive the architecture office of the future toward an application based office. It is expected that by 2030 the future architecture office will be a knowledge-based profession, where the ability to work independent of time and place will be normal practice. By this, the industry will be exempt from direct influences of architects whereby design input is based around programmed knowledge. It is expected that the future architectural office will develop through application software that utilizes the existing knowledge-base of architects. The new architectural office will form off the back of downloadable applications. Architectural information, data gained from years of practice, will be fed into these applications at a programming level. These applications will act on artificial intelligence, delivering solutions to clients based on historical knowledge and learned outcomes. This will change the face of architecture and the architectural office through the development of a mobile office, held in the hand of users.</p>
<p>The development of architectural products as an algorithm of design will emulate decision making. These algorithms will be based on information programmed into systems to form defined outcomes. This programmed information, and reasoning of knowledge is the basis of AI and is the first step in AI for architecture. The formation of solutions to problems through knowledge-based programming for architecture, refers to the ability to assume outcomes based on assigned information.</p>
<blockquote class="pull"><p>When joining two walls, this historical data defines how one wall joins to the next. The user can select the walls and location, but Revit assumes the outcome.</p></blockquote>
<p>In architectural documentation programs such as Revit, knowledge based methods are currently being used. As an example, wall joint algorithms. These rely on a set of rules defined by existing knowledge. This information has come from years of practice, and has been converted to a language that can be measured and written to code. When joining two walls, this historical data defines how one wall joins to the next. The user can select the walls and location, but Revit assumes the outcome. It is expected the architectural industry will use similar systems. This will slowly eliminate the need for clients to engage directly with architects, as the knowledge base of architects will be converted to data and fed into application software. As such, technological advancements make the project deliverables ‘better’ for client and consultants as more information is readily available.</p>
<p>We can draw parallels between how we work as architects and the direction AI has taken since the 1970’s. We rely on historical data, experiences, gained knowledge and client input to deliver solutions. As we do more and more of one type of project, we can rely less and less on specific client input. As design progresses in parallel with technology, we begin to develop a more rigorous and programmed approach to design.</p>
<blockquote class="pull"><p>That database is currently the architectural model.</p></blockquote>
<p>The forward progression of architecture must be in parallel to industry standards. And in line with the technological development of industries other than architecture. BIM is reliant on information gathered and fed into a database. That database is currently the architectural model. Design methodologies can be built into application based software and fed into such a model. Providing further design methodology based on information gathered at early design stages.</p>
<p>The level and detail that is capable through BIM documentation methods must then be considered. The methods used to deliver solutions currently, have grounds for development into programmable language. Current methods have begun the transformation from pen on paper, to data in a computer. It is expected then, that the progression of architectural design as a solution will move toward mobile data and eliminate the need for direct interaction with architects.</p>
<blockquote class="pull"><p>Picture architecture in the same manner in which you build Lego, block by block.</p></blockquote>
<p>Picture architecture in the same manner in which you build Lego, block by block. Each block has a set of rules that determines its location in relation other blocks. In the same way that each room, or space should have a set of parameters to drive its relationships. For example a bathroom is less likely to join a kitchen than it is to join a bedroom. This is even less likely to join a garage. Break it down further and define the specifics of space. If a bathroom, natural ventilation is required. If a bedroom, one wall must have a robe. So on and so forth. In this manner, values can be added to each room or space and fed back in to the knowledge-based engine. When a bedroom is selected, the program assumes a robe will be required, it will assume a percentage of airflow is needed, as well as lighting requirements. If there is an external wall, the program realises the robe must be on one of three other walls. The engine will then assign a solution to these rules. This is a learned process, and the more strength and trust that is given to the program, the more accurate it will become. It is expected that the ability to develop such algorithms will certainly change the face of architecture. Particularly the practice and office based systems that are in place today. It is likely that architects need to align ourselves with information technology as the reality is that architecture is now being driven by technology.</p>
<p>The growth of architecture over the past ten years can be compared to the 70’s technology boom. A massive overhaul and redefinition of the industry is due. In the same way Expert-systems changed the game with regard to AI, a similar change is prevalent in architecture currently. Architecture will fast become a product rather than a service, by converting architecture to algorithmic design and application based solutions. In providing a tool that the public that can use to design alone, architecture may continue to serve the community.</p>
<blockquote class="pull"><p>…systems will work to teach themselves</p></blockquote>
<p>Architects, have a large amount of stored knowledge. Made up of past projects, historical data, client needs and climate conditions. It is the need of architects to then rely on this information and develop new methods of design. With inexperienced clients, architects need to pass on an amount of architectural stored knowledge. This information begins to form patterns, and can be further broken down. The argument being, that if it is measurable then we should be able to code it. Design methodology can also be broken down and can be measured, based on historical data. Through application development, less human input will be required. Such systems will work to teach themselves, and rely less on direction from outside sources. Mimicking the AI development and knowledge-based programming that has been available since the 1970’s. And can be explained through ‘machine learning’ where algorithms that improve over time.</p>
<p>Applications that rely on historical data allows clients to design without the need of an architect. Not being dependant on time and place, and using knowledge-based software will define the new office. This will remove the architect, in the traditional sense. The architectural office would no longer exist and design decisions will be applied through historical examples stored in a database. The required outcomes can be fed into the program at the user end. With the decisions being made based on the stored historical data.</p>
<p>Through such programming of data, patterns emerge. Applications can be allowed access patterns later when the same or similar situations arises. These algorithms can be written in many ways, suited to any situation and with any desired outcome. This is not limited to technical data as spatial qualities can also be measured in this manner. As an example, quality of light, light penetration, ventilation, room size, room depth, height, texture, sound quality, and a raft of others are measurable design qualities. It can be argued that methods of design, or architectural ethos specific to individual architects may be lost. Though, it could be conceived that from Corbusier’s five points of new architecture, through to Tange’s Metabolist theories, all can be broken down and coded. This information when fed into applications, will allow users to design based on historical knowledge and data originally defined by architects without losing the quality of space developed through true architectural input. It could be considered then, that we are immortalising architects through a technological manner. Though the whole idea of replacing architects with a design application may not be the nicest thought, we are able to revalue architecture in a modern world and relay architectural design ethos to the technological generation.</p>

		<p>I think that there are two ways of interpreting this. One is where the AI gets so good at designing buildings that humans aren’t needed. I’ll call it the “Skynet” option. I’m sure that this is coming but I’m even more sure that it won’t be in the next 15 years.</p>
		<p>The other option is a watered down version of Skynet. The help offered by the computer grows in effectiveness. Before long the helpfulness passes some kind of threshold. I’m not sure where that is, but maybe it’s as useful as a new grad.</p>
		<p>At that point where the computers get helpful something big will happen. I can imagine all kinds of things but I won’t go into it here. It will  make things a lot faster as we are able to make changes at a coarser level. We can move a wall and not only will the wall re-join to other walls, but the room layout will change. This happens now but only within narrow parameters; it will become much ‘smarter’.</p>
		<p>The risk that I foresee isn’t that this will take away our livelihoods or make us drones. The risk that concerns me is that luddites will prevent technology from freeing us from that which is merely drudgery.</p>

	    <p>On an evolutionary level I expect that we will become AI or symbionts. We already have people wearing cochlear implants or pacemakers. Society will begin wearing things like Google glass and, like the internet the uptake will be fast and widespread, will be a part of everyday life.</p>
		<p>The natural progression is to enhance ourselves. For now we are naked cyborgs, electronic virgins.</p>
		<p>Tomorrow we will be upgrading the architecture of our minds and making massive cognitive upheavals.</p>
		<p>How we mentally and psychologically grapple with this extra processing power will be an even bigger challenge.</p>

	    <p>Combine the two and imagine being able to design through thought. Imagining/building a space in your conscious thought, and having all the rules that have been developed and established over time through the AI process click into place and construct themselves in a virtual reality. Ready to be explored. Close your eyes and walk through the space, check the boxes and confirm this is what you want. Hit print and watch a bunch of robots build your imagined architecture.

		<p>I wonder if General AI ‘Skynet, Kubricks ‘Hal’ option or even the less scary ‘Disembodied Specialist AI’ ie where machines can learn from and improve rudimentary tasks should be our focus. What I’m questioning more generally is – would a technological solution enable the AOOTF, or do we enable this through other mechanisms and drivers such as office culture that enables people assets, branding and leveraging off product hype and consumerism (do we sell product or service?), scientific type processes that enable unique solutions through research or an office that thrives and is driven by entrepreneurial relationships. I think that it would be a stretch to believe that our profession or the construction industry more generally could drive AI. I suggest that service based professions such as ours are at best reactionary to technology. Maybe? Or is there an opportunity that we could invest in writing script to remove rudimentary tasks. Has anyone raised the idea that the production of drawings is an archaic method? That is, build sophisticated 3D model and then reduce and communicate to 2D. In my view this will be seen as being as backwards and as defunt as tapes and CDs were.</p>
		<p>This is not to say that there are other offices out there that believe that AI and parametric, robotic and advanced digital logics will be the future in the realisation of built architecture. Gramazio and Kohler are a good example</p>
