    <article class="essay">
    <p>This collection of thoughts (not sure whether I’m brave enough to call it an essay with all of the necessary structural requirements) is in three parts—thoughts of now, thoughts on a possible then, and about how we may go about getting there. It is predicated on our current condition, as I don’t believe that there is huge value in inventing a hypothetical future without recognising the now.</p>
<p>Importantly, I believe there will be architect’s offices in the future. This means in the immediate and the long term—architects satisfy a need and a want and hence will continue to exist. Whether or not we actually satisfy the needs and wants now, let alone then, is a different story. Architects have been around a long time, practicing their craft. I’ve been fortunate enough to work with other architects from around the world; what’s surprising is how quickly you realise that you understand each other and see things in a particular way that those outside the profession seem not to. Sure, there’s jargon and technical talk but I actually mean something different—a level of the undefined that seems to pass subliminally between us. This suggests to me that the evolution of the profession is surprisingly similar around the world, which then suggests that if everyone’s doing it (sometimes relatively independently) it is actually evolving well. Which is perhaps optimistic in a globalized society. In any case, architects do seem able to see things differently to others, which is fundamentally the point of any profession—otherwise why bother with them in the first place?</p>
<h2>However. What do we actually do?</h2>
<p>If you were to ask everyone in our practice what they thought we did I suspect there would a surprising range of answers—but not surprising enough. By this I mean the answers would probably fit within a relatively small set of possibilities and much of the differences would be about frivolities regarding processes and definitions. Arguing whether a 10mm expressed joint is better or worse than a butt join is not a discussion about architecture (to be dramatic about it). Architecture is a pretty slippery thing to define, ranging from the choice of surface aesthetics of a building (which some of our clients seem to believe is all we do) through the concept of architect as the semi-omnipotent, all-seeing and all-knowing master creator and controller of a thing (building, city, network, universe). Architectural characters in fiction are often the idealised latter, including up to the extreme of the head baddie in the Matrix trilogy. Perhaps the Director of a film is the closest analogue (but not really as they are involved in the doing not just the designing of a film).</p>
<blockquote class="pull"><p>Steve is going to architect this piece of software</p></blockquote>
<p>The term architect is used loosely across ours and other industries. In Information Technology there are software architects and enterprise architects who essentially do what we do but with IT. They’ve even turned architect into a verb, ‘Steve is going to architect this piece of software’ or, ‘this network was architected by Celine’. Architected!</p>
<p>So, to have a future (which I believe we do), perhaps we need to have an idea about what being an architect is. Without clogging this essay with a rambling discussion I propose a traditional definition—architecture is the design of things (usually buildings), using the Vitruvian ideals of commodity, firmness and delight for the benefit of people. This definition is loose enough to have a bit of wriggle room. The important bits are the words design, benefit, people, commodity, firmness and delight. You have to design something for the benefit of someone(s) that satisfies his or her base and higher needs (which are inherently indefinable). There are ethical and critical overlays to what these words could and should mean, but I’m going to steer clear of those for now.</p>
<h2>Do we do that now?</h2>
<p>Sometimes. Balancing those words is hard and can be confusing and illogical. Not just to us but to clients and ‘stakeholders’ (ie people with a vested interest in getting what they want, regardless of what others may want). It is hard, as we need to constantly make choices that affect the equation—which is the act of design. Design is about making choices to achieve a particular outcome whilst balancing the (often disparate) needs and aspirations of those things involved in that outcome. This definition encompasses architectural thought and idea. It also includes the mechanism of actualising the outcome—the plotting and scheming often required to get around the fact that we are often unable to convince uncertain clients and others of the merits of our design.</p>
<blockquote class="pull"><p>We have moved further and further away from the actual delivery of the finished thing</p></blockquote>
<p>A key layer of the current condition is the slow accretion of barnacles on our profession, which are inhibiting our ability to evolve. As an old profession we are captured by entropy—by belief systems from different eras, by legislative requirements that are now beyond our control, by tired education systems and by a vast body of architectural theory. We have moved further and further away from the actual delivery of the finished thing, with more and more layers between it and us. Sophisticated mechanisms are in place to push us still further away, which we appear to meekly accept (building is hard, messy and often unpleasant in any case).</p>
<p>The profession is in a process of fragmenting. Arguably this change is a constant of the profession from the master-builder architect to now and we shouldn’t be afraid of it. However, there seems to be a growing schism—the separation of design and documentation (which construction could be conceivably added to). As we all argue, design is a continuous exercise through the life of a project with documentation and construction merely stages. With business pressure from organisations like Ridley and Co. Atlas and others, along with the continual growth of the design architect/executive architect role we can see a disintegration of our ability to actually do what we’ve been asked to do and what our clients (and our society) would like us to do. The distance between what we do and the finished item grows further —contractors, shop drawers, project managers, site engineers, expert trades and so on end up being as active participants in the design process (even if they don’t realise it) as us. This isn’t necessarily a bad thing as long as we understand it. Or, alternatively—the further away we are the less we are needed. What is the logical end point, delivery of a seductive visualisation only?</p>
<blockquote class="pull"><p>We get paid for doing it, not for how good it is […]. Do clients actually want us to be better?</p></blockquote>
<p>We also have a flawed business model. We are paid for a delivering a thing (a drawing, report, image) but we pay for the time required to do that thing. This includes staff, rent, power and increasingly, software. So, we try and get faster at delivering, which can come at the expense of being better at it. We get paid for doing it, not for how good it is (including getting a cut of the potential benefits to a client). Do clients actually want us to be better?</p>
<p>To be fashionable, we’re ripe for disruption by a clever startup. Perhaps firms like Case and Ar-Ma are already disrupting it..</p>
<p>Ok, there’s nothing new in any of this. The profession regularly bemoans its current condition, lack of understanding and respect and so on. I imagine that all professions do so. Life’s tough.</p>
<p>I would like our profession to re-engage with the word design. Design in its truest sense, accepting the length of time, resources and effort that is required to actually design rather than assemble. I don’t mean doing everything ourselves, or believing that we are the only ones capable of achieving the result (yes, we do tend to think of clients, consultants, councils, builders and tradespeople as the enemy).</p>
<p>I don’t think the AAOTF will actually be that different to that of today, with its quirks, inefficiencies and foibles. These are important to the process. To become the AAOTF we need to change the way we think about what we do and what an architect is. The enabler of this change is technology. It won’t make us better, but it will enable us to be better if we so choose.</p>
<p>The AAOTF will use technology vastly different to today (look back to how we worked 15 years ago to get a taste of this). Hopefully in the future the technology won’t be in the way but will do what it aspires to do—automate the grind tasks (door schedule anyone?) to give time for considered decision-making. This, I hope is what the AAOTF will be about—reduced time producing drawings (or models, or virtual reality mockups or whatever) and more time interrogating the problem and the context of the problem through the lens of our expertise. This means understanding our cognitive biases, learning to think critically, reduced reaching for the previous or easiest answer and seeking understanding from outside of the profession. It also means innovating. Actually innovating.</p>
<p>The biggest barrier to this isn’t the technology itself (which is evolving so quickly that it’s fair to assume it will eventually do what it says it does now) but us. We need to stop fighting it and crawl out of our mid-20th century model of how we do our thing.</p>
<p>The AAOTF will be a great place. It will be fun, lively and clever. It will be a place where we have expertise in what we do. This expertise is nurtured and grown—and not just by learning on the job, but by constant education in many fields (using that extra time that has been freed up). We’ll continue to adjust our business model to value our services better, and to share in the benefits that these bring. This means that we will continue to get better at educating our clients and others that our expertise, training and experience is actually valuable to them. This means valuing what we do and not giving it away. We will understand the value of our IP and distribute it wisely. We will recognize the benefits of open-source.</p>
<p>We will continue to wrestle with time-based payment for resources (which will be the model for everything in the next few years). Perhaps we can evolve to valuing our own services based on time—although how long does a good idea take though? This is a conundrum.</p>
<blockquote class="pull"><p>we’ll stop saying things like ‘I just want to focus on the design.’—it’s all the design!</p></blockquote>
<p>We will become ever more curious about what we do and what others do, rather than seeing them as a threat, irrelevancies or just too damn hard. This means that we’ll stop saying things like ‘I just want to focus on the design.’—it’s all the design! This means embracing others working in and around our profession as we will have learnt to deal with management approaches that try and maintain control through speed, infantilisation of our skills and what appears to be desire to keep us wrong footed.</p>
<p>We’ll continue to expand what we do to the broad definition of design, from before the project is conceived through to assisting in the managing the finished item. Yes, to be clear, we will engage in the ongoing facilities management of the building for its entire lifetime. In essence put our money where our mouth is. Part of this means not being afraid to take back what used to be ours and perhaps should be ours—hire façade engineers, industrial designers and landscape architects; as well as shop drawers, software engineers, process engineers, real estate agents and who knows what else. A diverse practice will be a strong practice.</p>
<p>We will use new tools and workflows and not be afraid to experiment or change these quickly. These will allow us to make decisions later and later without worrying how the drawings can be changed in the tiny amount of time left (there’s that time problem again).</p>
<p>We won’t be afraid to say no and we won’t be afraid to say yes. We’ll consider decisions like any other design problem. Our teams will have reduced in size and be more diverse as technology and workflows improve. Much of what we do now can be semi-automated, imagine what this will be in fifteen years. This is the low value, repetitive work that we have to spend time doing now. This means that we will have adjusted our philosophy on risk management. Risk is an acceptable part of business (and life)—it shouldn’t be eliminated, rather accepted and used as just another tool. Others will solve issues such as data security and availability without us having to do so (this is unlikely, but anyway).</p>
<p>As individuals and as a practice we will seek agency in our work—this doesn’t mean absolute control, rather that we able to successfully influence the outcome based upon our expertise and experience (which we have significantly developed) Critical to the success of this is the need to doubt—to doubt concepts, ideas, solutions and approaches, With this doubt comes optimism—that we can improve upon these things through the application of a holistic design approach. Doubting what we do whilst being optimistic we can make it better is the conflict that forms the wellspring of fresh ideas—ideas that are truly tested, analysed and interrogated with an open understanding of our cognitive biases, limitations and capabilities.</p>
<p>Sure, we’ll have virtual reality presentation tools, rapid prototyping, though controlled design systems, hologram projectors and so on. Buildings will be part constructed by robots (who won’t be interested in drawings, only models). But these are just dressing. The real challenge will be addressing the real problem that we are given to solve.</p>
<p>How do we get there? Easy—stop fighting it.</p>

<p>The upset about the idea of someone architecting a thing is interesting. The difference between “architect” and “building designer” is a distinction that I’ve never really been able to explain in a satisfactory way.</p>
<p>I actually think it’s a good idea to separate the roles! (Cue raging mob with pitchforks!)</p>
<p>My def: To architect is a specific subset of design that is about coordinating many disparate and complex elements into a coherent whole.</p>
<p>If that works out then it doesn’t matter if you are architecting a hospital or a computer chip. I think that if we accepted that then it would release a lot of the unnecessary, pent-up anxiety that our creed has accumulated.</p>
<p>It needn’t be a problem with accreditation either, it’s just a word. You could be a registered building designer who architects hospitals and nothing would have changed except a little vocabulary.</p>
</li>

<li><span class="commenter">Ian Kirkland</span>
<p>There is a converse view to the comment that we’ve a flawed business model. </p>
<p>Pricing on fixed fee allows a practice to earn above ordinary profit on a project. Hourly rate fees mean you can only ever make the return that is built into the charge rate, and only then if the client agrees to pay for all the hours spent on the project.</p>
<p>There have certainly been examples at BVN where the client believed we had something worth paying for, we agreed a good lump sum fee, delivered the project well and made a ‘super’ profit.</p>
<p>Accountants and lawyers mostly work on hourly rates, but I’ve regularly seen discussion about getting to a fixed fee structure. BVN pays it’s accountant a fixed fee to produce a thing (it’s financial audit). The benefit is we know how much it’s going to cost, we work with them to do the job well (so they can charge the same next year) and I reckon financially they do OK out of this.</p>
<p>I guess the success of the fixed fee arrangement starts with our ability not only to value and promote ourselves, including allowing enough effort to permit good design, but also to continually live up to that promotion? Next time round the client will be more likely to pay a good price?</p>

<p>I find architecture a seductive act. The way that an architect is skilled to think skews our prism of the built and natural world. We simply can’t act without designing. Other professions don’t have this skill. If in doubt I suggest – ask your client, ask the engineer, ask the project manager. </p>
<p>They would love to have this mindset and many will agree that they are failed designers in their own mind. In understanding their deficiencies I believe that they always will seek out architects, now and in the future. They need champions of design and building, facilitators, collaborater’s and doers.</p>
<p>I believe our profession is relevant as it has been for hundreds of years. I believe that we are well placed for designing the future. I’m wonder what comes next? After our hyper post modern period</p>
</li>

<li><span class="commenter">Simon Swain</span>
<p>I also agree with this view that values our profession through respecting all participants that enable ‘design’, but bringing this back to topic about the future of our practice and profession, I wonder</p>
<p>– Is suggesting that architects are champions of design going to ’cause all the problems’?<br />
– Is this a ‘barnacles’ preventing evolution? I it ok to say that we have unique skillsets that other don’t? Is this of value, will it bring us value in the future or is rethinking and repositioning manitory for our survival?<br />
– Do we agree that architecture has instrinsic problems? Do architects have negative views of our profession. Can it be fixed? Does it need fixing?<br />
– Can architects extend their design thinking beyond our current niche? I definitely think we are well skilled. We are always talking about loosing market share. Aren’t we?<br />
– Can architects be design champions without de-valuing others?<br />
– Would other architects agree with this definition that design is “an activity of making decisions in order to reach an outcome”. Can it be reduced this basically? Does this look like MVRDV? Would Gehry or Gaudi fit this defitintion? Can process lead to desirable outcomes? Is desire measurable and axial?</p>
<p>What do others think?</p>
</li>

<li><span class="commenter">Domino Risch</span>
<p>I’m going to ask a controversial question: Is ‘design’ defined in an architects mind as pertaining to the ‘aesthetic’ – the poetry or the metaphysical concern of the thing we are making?  And the further –  is the definition of ‘architecture’ then as Ben suggests –  the coordinating of many disparate and complex elements into a coherent whole?</p>
<p>Is the element of beauty (in whatever form the architect deems beautiful) creating this schism of definition?</p>
<p>As an interior designer who cannot access the label ‘architect’  – I sometimes feel the word is perhaps over-valued, as I consider what we do as designers to be equally valid and important as what any architect can produce.  Sometimes more so because of the need that we usually have to respond to really complex functional, business and cultural drivers which designers of buildings sometimes don;t need to worry about.  And in reality – is what we do in a workplace and interiors world (where we generally don’t create the envelope for our clients – we just mush up the insides)  any different in essence to what architecture is?</p>
<p>Yet we are treated and labelled and thought of differently?<br />
I say let it go people.</p>
<p>There – controversial post done.</p>
<p>D</p>

<p>To throw in my two cents… There is a brilliant book titled Hello World by Alice Rawsthorn, where her key postulation is that despite its ubiquity, there is a lot of confusion about just what design is. She talks about everything from the design of the terracotta warriors to the iphone. I haven’t got it in front of me so I’m paraphrasing, but I like how she found the very first recorded definition of designer as someone who plots and schemes. </p>
<p>Anyway, it’s worth a read… here is some more info:<br />
<a href="http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/mar/10/hello-world-alice-rawsthorn-review" rel="nofollow">http://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/mar/10/hello-world-alice-rawsthorn-review</a> </p>
<p>I think architects are specialist designers, and I think design should definitely be our number one priority – whether it be architecture or interiors, all that means is that you’re applying different technical skills to a design process. </p>
<p>It is interesting once you start looking into the design methodologies and processes of other creative fields. Sure the technical skills are different, but the methodologies run in parallel to ours. I remember watching the 2014 documentary Dior and I – about Raf Simmon’s first couture collection at Dior thinking that what we do is so similar to what he does – only at the end we have a designed space and he has a designed garment. </p>

<p>Or Objectified (or any of the Gary Hustwitz documentaries) where he explores industrial design – same design methodologies, different skills, different outcomes…</p>

<p>I read that section of the piece as a call to find a way that would motivate us to do better. We currently have a pricing structure that doesn’t benefit us extra if we are really good and is only a problem if we do our job so badly that we get sued. Wouldn’t it be nice if we could work out a way that we could earn more if we really nailed a project. I think it’d be complicated–performance contracts are slippery–but it might be a nice change.</p>
<p>As a direct question for you Ian, how much of our work comes from repeat customers? (Be that the same organisation, or the same person moving between organisations.)</p>
<p>I’m not keen on hourly rates, they devalue innovation and efficiency. I’d be really interested in working out a way that we could get “well done” bonuses without them turning into secret penalties.</p>

<a href="http://notionparallax.co.uk/wordpress/" rel="external nofollow" class="url">Ben Doherty</a>
<p>I’m going to call bullshit on the first paragraph. I think that this is exactly the mindset that is causing all of the problems. Perhaps it comes from a definition issue. Maybe we think of design as different things, so I guess I’d better put my cards on the table.</p>
<blockquote><p>Design is an activity of making decisions in order to reach an outcome.</p></blockquote>
<p>That will probably require some hedging.<br />
The outcome might not be know at the start of the process.<br />
The desire is usually for a change to be effected that can be measured on one or more axes.<br />
Under that definition a general designs a military campaign, a software engineer designs a large programme, a project manager designs the delivery of a project, a lawyer designs a contract.</p>
<p>If we use a definition of design that excludes these competencies then we are demeaning their craft. It feels to me that if we demean their craft then we aren’t inviting them to value ours</p>
<p>Our design competency is within a reasonably narrowly defined field. We would be stuffed if we needed to <em>design</em> a PCB or a sewerage system for a city. But I would imagine that an electronic engineer would be just a stuffed if they needed to design a hospital.</p>
</li>

<li><span class="commenter">Tim Crawshaw</span>
<p>Isn’t ‘making decisions to reach an outcome’ just being alive? If I want to go to the corner shop to get a bag of chips I have to make several decisions for this simple task – how much money to take, whether to take the lift or the stairs etc… I don’t think any activity that involves thinking ahead – as you include above lawyers, project managers etc – should be called design. </p>
<p>In fact – your assumption that the other trades mentioned are also design activities might reinforce what Simon said about us (architects) carrying the designer mindset with us in our everyday lives – just because you would ‘design’ a contract doesn’t mean a lawyer would!</p>
<p>T</p>
</li>

<li><span class="commenter">Ben Doherty</span>
<p>I’d say that a lawyer absolutely would say that they’d designed a contract. The only way to find out is to ask a lawyer.</p>
<p>Designing a strategy is absolutely design. Perhaps I should add a caveat–one that Christopher Alexander has beaten me to–the distinction between conscious design and unselfconsciousness design. I can self-consciously design my breakfast routine and that’s design. Someone else could produce a contract without thinking about what they were doing (just changing the name and the date etc.). I’d say that it’s possible to design a building almost as unselfconsciously!</p>
<p>The design mindset is a bit of a slippery concept. The very slipperyness of it is what has been the downfall of the respectability of the ‘design thinking’ movement. Advocates would come to an industry and tell them about the wonders of using design thinking and the industry would say “that sounds great, but that’s what we do already, we just didn’t have a name for it.”</p>
<p>A lot of this is arguing from a position of ignorance. I haven’t really done enough reading around ‘design’ as applied in other industries. My anecdotal work from my law, medicine, software, manufacturing friends is that they all think of their jobs, or at least parts of their jobs, as design.</p>

<p>Ben – in your view how does this way of thinking position us for the future? I’m curious. </p>
<p>Any opportunities? Where should ‘design’ be positioned in the office of the future? Does it take the number one position? Where do you think it is positioned now for BVN? Is design talked about enough within the studio? Does it bubble within the studio and does our culture support this? Are design ideas and way of thinking about design interrogated enough? Do interogated design ideas lead to better otucomes and better ideas? Should we have a collective ‘approach’ to design? Is this relevant? Do our design methods leading to outcomes and built work differentiate us enough in a competitive market place? Do we want to compete at this level? Is this required of a leading edge practice?</p>

<p>The first thing I want to say is that acknowledging that other professions also do design <em>doesn’t</em> in any way denigrate what we do. My argument (somewhat clumsily made so far) is that there is a lot to learn from all those other groups. Acknowledging that they have a lot to teach us is the first step in a giant leap in our capability.</p>
<p>As long as we <em>think</em> we have a monopoly on being designers we are propagating an arrogance that prevents learning. There are facts from other professions that we are happy to learn, but there are also methods and ways of thinking.</p>
<p>I think that design should be <em>totally central</em> to the Architectural Office Of The Future. All the drudgery that we do these days will be removed and we will do very little other than design. I think that what design means to us will change significantly. We don’t do nearly enough user research (before or after our current engagement period).</p>
<p>I don’t think that we discuss design nearly enough. We talk about its products ad nausium. If I see another person frothing over an alto vase I might lose control entirely. What we don’t talk about is methodology. Other fields have totally leapfrogged the ‘traditional’ design fields of print design and architecture. User experience design, software design and service design have all borrowed heavily from psychology and anthropology, use statistical analysis methods etc. to make sure that they are producing what people want and in the best possible way. These guys define methodologies (lean product development, human centric design etc.) and then because they are defined they can critique and improve them.</p>
<p>I’d say that the <em>only</em> way to differentiate ourselves in a sustainable way is through delivering a great product. Almost all other differentiators are a race to the bottom (cheaper, faster etc.). I’d say that thinking about being a “leading edge practice” is stupid–we either are one, or we’re dead.</p>
<p>This has probably come out very long, but I’m enjoying this thread!</p>
