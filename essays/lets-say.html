    <p class="introduction">Let’s say the future is 15 years away.</p>
<p class="introduction">Let’s say we are still an architecture practice</p>
<p class="introduction">Let’s say I’m still here.</p>
<p class="introduction">What will be different?</p>
<p class="introduction">Physical stuff: People. The space. The technology. Paper.</p>
<p class="introduction">The other stuff: Culture. Behaviour. Strategy.</p>
<div class="idea-box">
<h2>PEOPLE:</h2>
<p>Our people are our greatest and in some ways, our only asset. Without them, the archived projects, the photos, the models are all somewhat meaningless. In 15 years we will still have people. Our people ARE our business. I think people will still come to work. I think a studio environment that provides opportunities for conversations, review, discourse, a place for teams to bond and thrive will still be essential. It’s about being together, engaged and open to new ideas—spending time alone at home or remotely does not develop people necessarily, it develops work (which is important) but not everything. There are more of us, or less, but we are vibrant, confident, inquisitive and energised. We are determined, we are strong, we have ability. We are leaders, not followers. We embrace others and always seek to learn.</p>
</div>
<div class="idea-box">
<h2>THE SPACE:</h2>
<p>In 15 years we are somewhere else. We have less desks than people. We have more spaces for design oriented collaboration—pin up space, projection space, video and phone conference space. We have more spaces for retreat and individual work. We might stand up to work and only occasionally sit down. We might arrange ourselves in groups and teams, but we accept that some of us are mobile and our business is more done outside of our space than in it. We use our space as an incubator. We test installations. Ceiling types. Floor finishes. Wall claddings. Furniture. We see all sorts of people in the space—not just our own and those we are immediately working with. People come to see us not because we are an architecture practice, but because we are innovators. We inspire others from unrelated fields to see what our people and our space—our business—have achieved.</p>
</div>
<div class="idea-box">
<h2>THE TECHNOLOGY:</h2>
<p>Computers and their bits are smaller in 2030. I hope there is less screen space so we can see each other more and actually talk. There are no fixed desk phones. There are no CPUs. Large monitors for team discussions are common. Large format touch screen tables are everywhere—like an iPad but A1 format for sketching (is there any yellow trace anymore???) Wireless headsets. I have a Microsoft Surface with phone functionality—combining as many objects into one as possible. Booking a meeting room is easy (not like in 2015!). Email is much less prevalent but at the expense of other ways of connecting: IM / social media / Google hangouts increasing? Data is in the cloud and accessible from absolutely anywhere, making working remotely no different to being in the studio. We use new forms of software in experimental ways. We can even do our timesheets from home. We might have a digital person at reception—freeing Fiona to be our emotional salve and organisational champion from wherever it suits her.</p>
</div>
<div class="idea-box">
<h2>PAPER:</h2>
<p>In 2030 there is still paper. Some people can’t let go. Most of us scanned our crap years ago. Paper is not spread across the entirety of our working surfaces, if needed it is on walls, or in neat piles in cabinets. We might mark things up by hand still but we don’t keep hard copy when done—scan scan scan. We threw out our shop drawing stamp at least a decade ago when everyone finally learned how to stamp a PDF. What we do have though is books. Visual inspiration. Magazines and research papers. Newspapers are perused by shared tablet and AIO PCs that are around everywhere. Murdoch press abandoned gateway accounts 5 years ago—online access to papers is free.</p>
</div>
<div class="idea-box">
<h2>CULTURE:</h2>
<p>We have changed. REALLY. Compared to 2015 we have more emotional intelligence. Most people think about and are aware of how their behaviour affects others. Voice of judgement, voice of fear, voice of cynicism—they are still there, but under control. We love having our children and our pets around. We cultivate difference. Different ways of being engaged with US. Sometimes obvious, sometimes not. IT’s OK to work hours that suit you. It’s OK to work from somewhere else. It’s OK to be provocative and challenging, but it’s NOT ok to be disrespectful. Life happens at work. Work is not where you are, it’s what you do. It’s OK to get your dry-cleaning, take the kids to the park, see your mum. We TRUST you, or you wouldn’t be here. We are engaged and passionate, we love what we do.</p>
</div>
<div class="idea-box">
<h2>BEHAVIOUR:</h2>
<p>We are above all, professional. Our behaviour between ourselves and to our clients and industry peers is representative of our organisation. We are prepared, diligent, advanced. We under-promise and over-deliver. We understand that we are in the service industry and that our clients are the originators of, and the beneficiaries of our successes. They are NOT obstacles to be manoeuvred around, they are not the enemy. We dress for success—we look sharp. Impressions matter. We manage our time properly. In 2030 we turn up to meetings—even internal meetings—on time, because we are respectful of others.</p>
</div>
<div class="idea-box">
<h2>STRATEGY:</h2>
<p>It’s 2030 and our business model has changed. We moved away from being one off, single project ‘problem solvers’, to being more like an accountant (eeewwwwww) that is a trusted advisor who consults on a range of things. We have long term partnerships with our clients. We are involved in a range of areas—strategy, leasing, development, culture, engagement, health and wellbeing, research and development, productivity. We have expertise in all these areas. We work not only with the end users of the places that we create, but those who are instrumental in advising those end users. We work with developers, leasing agents, property owner and community groups. We work with governments at all levels. We don’t just solve one problem, we solve multiple problems. We are business partners not just architects.</p>
</div>
<p class="introduction">2030 seems so far away. But it’s not. Before you know it we will be there. What I’ve written is what I am passionate about—our culture. But what it really boils down to is people and relationships. If we get better at managing those, our business will get better, too. Better enough to get us to 2015 in amazing shape.</p>

	<li><span class="commenter">Ben Doherty</span>
	<p>This is great. It feels like it might be what things will be like in 15 years, but really there’s nothing stopping us doing all of these things right now!</p>
	<p>I find that we have a historical culture of pretty severe paternalism. That’s slowly changing, but I really like the line: “<em>We TRUST you, or you wouldn’t be here.</em>” I haven’t found a single situation where hiding information from my colleagues has been beneficial. Yet it is the default, safe position for a lot of things. I’d certainly join a call for greater transparency!</p>
	</li>

	<li><span class="commenter">Glenn Irwin</span>
	<p>I think the paper aspect of the office will be a lot more immediate and transparent in the near future.<br />
	I imagine that given recent progresses with Nano paper devices and wet/dry technology will mean our tablets, project record pads, sketch pads, scanners and screens, newspaper etc will be all one device and immediately recorded to clouds. Its flexible (or not), physically scale-able and appears or disappears whenever you like. No more having to carry stuff except for the various quantum processors and comms devices planted under your skin.</p>
	<p>The device is not only physical but stretch it over you and become immersive. Today when you look around at all the faces planted in screens tomorrow will be a workplace ballet of people moving through a series of virtual dance moves as they meet with clients and showing them through their future design concept. Its often  referred to as song and dance session.  </p>
	<p>Transparency and work will be ubiquitous by nature in the future realm. Not just in the workplace but everywhere. Like the smallest molecule can be located, positioned and governed; work will flow from us like an immersed synestheasia of experiences that is recorded and driven to its data cloud. </p>
	<p>Perhaps the physical world will become less interesting and almost abandoned for a much more controllable and augmented sense of reality.  Existenz.</p>
	<p>One may need to work hard to secure anything private and “retreaters” will form a new world of seclusion.<br />
	Life in “beefspace” however will be like moving through a series of thresholds that engage your senses at various public/private levels. What we have already as a structured public/private society will seem blended, dissolved. After-all isn’t work and non work already a blurred boundary.</p>
	<p>My brain hurts…lunch!</p>

	<p>Love the idea of a workplace ballet…….beautiful imagery there…..</p>

	<p>2030 seems like an exciting place to work! The essay paints a bright future for our industry, with many developments that would greatly enhance the way we work. I am looking forward to having less paper and clutter around, with a more streamlined environment.</p>
	</li>

	<li><span class="commenter">Jessica Enander</span>
	<p>I agree, I very exciting future to look forward to!<br />
	Just as the author noted “Life happens at work. Work is not where you are, it’s what you do”, I believe this is the way forward culturally. As younger generations of architects and designer enter the workplace – a need for a  flexible, collaborative and transparent work culture will be what engages us and ignites our creativity. A sense of ownership will increase our productivity and hopefully the new technology will enhance our efficiency. Bring on 2030!</p>

	<li><span class="commenter">Fiona</span>
	<p>Bendy, I have found that there a couple of common denominators when it comes to people coveting information…..here it is, for what its worth.<br />
	Information is power – I believe people who may feel insecure, not necessarily at work, but perhaps in their private life, can be information hoarders.  I guess it makes them feel they have something up their sleeve to use on their terms.<br />
	Some people just don’t get it – for some it just doesn’t occur to them that people need to know, for others I think its a case of ‘why should I tell them, it doesn’t concern them’<br />
	Whether this be true or not, I agree, hiding information is rarely beneficial and more often than not, leads to misunderstandings and avoidable frustration.</p>
	<p>(p.s.  I was honoured to be named in this essay – thank you Dr/ Mr/ Mrs/ Ms/ Miss Anon)<br />
