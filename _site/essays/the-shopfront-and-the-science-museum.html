<li>Technology will be at a point where we can collaborate effectively, immediately and meaningfully in teams / projects regardless of our location.</li>
<li>Practice is global with strategically located ‘Flagship’ studios, and other studios around the world where we have projects (either independently or in collaboration with local practices) of varying scales.</li>
<li>A Flagship studio indicates the presence of the range of diverse roles. They are not necessarily large scale however have great presence in the city which they are located, attract large numbers of the public to the educational and cultural program, and project types within these studios generally represent the whole body of work of our practice. Other studios varying from ‘stand-alone’ to ‘shared’ have reduced diversity in staffing and tend to more traditional architectural roles. Other studios may evolve to become Flagship studios.</li>
<li>All staff who work at any of the BVN studios have experienced working within one or more of the flagship studios. They are initiated through operational, educational and team-building programs. Through these experiences they develop an understanding of BVN culture, the work ethos and meet a wide variety of staff whom they will collaborate with in future projects regardless of which studio they end up in.</li>
<li>Project teams are not determined by location but by skill-set, individual development goals and availability. Team boundaries are fluid—people can belong to more than one team. Teams can include members from different parts of the world in different time zones.</li>
<li>There is greater scope for workplace flexibility. For example someone based in Sydney might work early in the morning with their NZ-based team, have the day free and then continue working in the evening with a team in Hong Kong. This will enable greater numbers of parents to work around family commitments and return to the workforce.</li>
<li>All staff have the option to work part-time (4 days) to pursue other architectural related interests. For example, tutoring, personal study/projects. Given that a greater number of people work less hours, there needs to be a greater body of staff members to draw upon in relation to the number of projects being undertaken. This does not necessarily mean that BVN becomes larger in scale (we may choose to be more selective and undertake less projects).</li>
<li>The skill base and project aspirations of each individual staff member are widely shared and known amongst the organisation. Communication and collaboration skills are paramount for team members to work successfully in flexible and virtual contexts across time zones.</li>
<li>Staff members include people from other sectors to provide first hand input into project-types. For example, there are educators, health and sport professionals who are at the forefront of thinking in their professions and who act as consultants throughout the practice and contribute to research.</li>
<li>Teams involved in R&amp;D, education, public programs and marketing are also global in nature. The work of these teams draw a wide audience to BVN’s studios or website through exhibitions, forums, talks, films, school programs, papers etc. that are attractive to and involve the general public, not just other architects. Partnerships around these offering are developed between schools, universities, cultural institutions and other practitioners and businesses.</li>
<li>Staff traditionally only associated with the activities of architectural teams actively engage and are involved with inputs and outputs from these teams. Outputs are shared widely throughout the practice through varying formats, in person, physically through installation, and virtually.</li>
<li>R&amp;D outputs are varied. They can be written in the form of papers which can be presented at conferences. They can also be physical, whether as an exhibition or travelling exhibition. Or they can involve the development of a prototype for something identified through project work which doesn’t exist in the marketplace.</li>

	<li><span class="commenter">Ben Doherty</span>
	<p>I really like this idea. When I was at uni we often talked about what our studio would be like when we were real architects. Mine was 4 shop units that housed a bakery, a cafe, a model making studio and a bookshop, and then the studio would be along the back. (Imagine a 4 pronged E.) Thinking back on it we probably wouldn’t have actually needed any dedicated studio space. Anyway, the street frontage idea appeals to me. Given my obvious bias I’m going to make some observations and ask some questions.</p>
	<p>There is an assumption that having more women able to practice is a good thing. I agree that it is, but I’m not sure if it has ever been proven beyond anecdotally that it’s a good thing. This feels similar to be various rants about architects not being explicit about value. What benefit does the shopfront model have when it comes to improving equality? Is that just a general aspiration?</p>
	<p>The definitions are interesting, but it feels backwards to define ourselves with reference to them. The dictionary’s job is to report on the state of the world, and if we choose to drift–or change completely–the definition then it’s our prerogative.</p>
	<p>The section on stages is really interesting. A lot of the discussion in DADB revolve around this extension. I wonder if it’s time to let go of the middle though? on the first diagram (1-5) you identify that we aren’t really trained to do 3-5, and that it’s unlikely that we’ll be able to generate much value there in the future. (I know we sometimes make a lot of profit documenting, but I doubt that we’ll continue to do so if lower cost options emerge.) I’d be interested to see what would happen in the second scenario (0-7). It feels like sections 0-3 are much less susceptible to process optimisation that will lead to competition on fee. Lots of documentation can be offloaded onto computer-intelligence (think Revit drawing sections) or onto low cost staff in other countries. Sections 1-3 and 7 (winning work, Briefing, Concept design, detailed design, negotiating with councils and then ultimately Post occupancy analysis) all require physical presence and is much less automatable.</p>
	<p>Street frontage has done amazing things for Apple’s bottom line. It’s one of the things that has changed them from a company that sells computers like Dell or IBM into a company that sells lifestyles. People are willing to pay a lot more for a lifestyle than for some silicon and plastic. Apple’s shops aren’t just places to see ‘things’. Their lecture space, and actually most of the rest of their space is about selling that lifestyle. Maybe that’s what this museum idea would do for our industry?</p>
	</li>
	<li><span class="commenter">Luke Chalmers</span>
	<p>As I went through this one, I found myself considering more, the branding of architecture, similar to what Ben says about Apple and the street frontage. What if BVN became a brand, an architectural brand. In the same way Apple is to technology?</p>
	</li>
	<li><span class="commenter">Jared Bird</span>
	<p>This is really interesting.</p>
	<p>In the diagram that compares architectural practice to science museums, all of the different aspects of the practice (public programs, R&amp;D, marketing) have been drawn at the same size. I wonder how it would look if they were drawn at different sizes to represent how much of the practice’s resources they each utilize. How much time would actually be spent producing architecture? What would it mean if it was less than the other activities? I think that would be ok.</p>
	<p>It seems this idea would only work in a very large organisation.</p>
	<p>It seems like a lot of the activities described (the promotion of architecture, helping the public understand what we do) are currently being provided by other organisations – universities or the AIA, for example. What are the benefits of private companies taking on this activity? Maybe we could take on some of the other roles these (para-industry?) groups traditionally provide. Maybe we could set up a boutique university or research centre that offers international scholarships. Maybe we could become a publisher responsible for a world-wide architecture journal. Or something . . .</p>
