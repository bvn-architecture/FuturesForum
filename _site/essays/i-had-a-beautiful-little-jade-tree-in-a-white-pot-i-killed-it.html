    <div class="slide"><img src="./I had a beautiful little jade tree in a white pot… I killed it. _ Tropos_files/jade-tree.jpg" alt="jade tree" /></div>
<p>Over the course of 6 years and three house moves, I watched my jade tree’s slow decline. The tree grew, the pot stayed the same. I watered it the required amount, even put it outside to get some sun but the leaves just started to go yellow as the nutrients dried up. I don’t know how it survived for so long snatching what it could from the atmosphere, deep breaths that turned to shallow gasps. If only I had replenished it sooner, before it was too late…it would have had a chance to survive.</p>
<p>Anything that is living needs to have the right conditions to thrive.</p>
<p>We need to establish a creative climate.</p>
<h2>You only lose relevance when you can’t find relevance.</h2>
<div class="slide"><img src="./I had a beautiful little jade tree in a white pot… I killed it. _ Tropos_files/relevance.jpg" alt="relevance" /></div>
<p>My position is optimistic.</p>
<p>Architecture (in whatever form it takes) only loses its relevance when we can no longer find a way of intellectually moving forward. Our goal must be to continue to evolve and keep pace with the world in which we live and aspire to inhabit. We need to maintain our curiosity.</p>
<p>Mediocre practices will get swallowed up by large multi-disciplinary firms (AECOM, Jacobs etc.) because they can only compete on price and they can’t keep pace with change.</p>
<p>The tail end practices will dribble on…</p>
<p>The practice that thrives will occupy the space that finds relevance in leading edge or bleeding edge pursuits.</p>
<h2>Improving our hit rate.</h2>
<div class="slide"><img src="./I had a beautiful little jade tree in a white pot… I killed it. _ Tropos_files/hit-rate.jpg" alt="hit rate" /></div>
<p>For quite some time, we have watched ideas come and go, occasionally they flourish and develop into something of value for the Practice. If we considered our ideas to development success rate like we do a competition, we would be disappointed with our hit rate.</p>
<p>Just like that little jade tree, we haven’t got the climatic conditions right to oxygenate ideas. If we can’t create an environment where ideas can develop then we can’t maintain our relevance.</p>
<p>Our biggest risk to our future is the lack of time, motivation and burn out of our people.</p>
<p>We need structural change to enable a culture of curiosity and create an environment where everyone is motivated to develop ideas into value adding contributions for the whole of BVN and the planet.</p>
<p>We all need to feel an internal need to act.</p>
<h2>Clear the blockages.</h2>
<div class="slide"><img src="./I had a beautiful little jade tree in a white pot… I killed it. _ Tropos_files/80_20-Copy-Copy.jpg" alt="80_20 - Copy - Copy" /></div>
<p>Let’s remove the barriers that exist. If we consider the burden of time and burn out as some of our major risks, we must change the way we work. We can’t keep doing the same thing and expect a different result.</p>
<p>We need an 80/20 time model. 80% BVN time, 20% individual/team pursuit.</p>
<p>Our employment contract currently restricts individual pursuit within the Practice “without the prior consent of our National Director”. If we remove this caveat and rethink the way we remunerate, this will clear some of the existing blockages and remove mixed messages.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-16072" src="./I had a beautiful little jade tree in a white pot… I killed it. _ Tropos_files/conditions.jpg" alt="conditions" width="795" height="223" /></p>
<p>20% of our time is within our control.</p>
<h2>Choose how you work.</h2>
<div class="slide"><img src="./I had a beautiful little jade tree in a white pot… I killed it. _ Tropos_files/choose-how-you-work-Copy-Copy.jpg" alt="" /></div>
<p>How do we pay for 80/20 and allow everyone to share in success?</p>
<p>There are two parts to this.</p>
<p>Firstly, everyone receives a core salary of 80% of their salary for 80% of their time, plus the usual entitlements.</p>
<p>For the remaining 20% of earnings you have choices;&lt;/<p>You can choose to work on hourly rates developing ideas or core project work for BVN;</p>
<p>You can work on your own private projects at no cost to BVN but with access to all facilities;</p>
<p>Or you can lie on the beach, spend time with the kids and not work that day.</p>
<p>This model enables the business to employ enough additional people to create time for everyone.</p>
<p>Our structure should enable us not disable us.</p>
<h2>Invest in ideas and get a dividend.</h2>
<div class="slide"><img src="./I had a beautiful little jade tree in a white pot… I killed it. _ Tropos_files/invest-in-ideas.jpg" alt="invest in ideas" /></div>
<p>Secondly, we should have a way that everyone can share in our success.</p>
<p>Ownership could be about investing in ideas rather than an operational model of the business. The idea of ‘forever’ is defunct. Ownership can be flexible and controlled by the individual.</p>
<p>Like an internal crowd funding model, anyone at BVN can invest into ideas, projects, and initiatives that you believe will can be successfully developed, whether you are working on it or not. You could invest $1 or $1000 or your time. If the agreed measures of success (which should be based on value to the Practice not money) are achieved a dividend is paid relative to your investment.</p>
<p>20% of your time can be spent developing ideas outside core projects that will add value to BVN.</p>
<p>Our currency is our ideas.</p>
<h2>Graze less.</h2>
<div class="slide"><img src="./I had a beautiful little jade tree in a white pot… I killed it. _ Tropos_files/grazing.jpg" alt="grazing" /></div>
<p>We are currently habitual grazers, short of time, lightly skimming the surface off ideas without in-depth development leading to an outcome or substantial end result. A creative climate will motivate us to push through from idea to end product.</p>
<p>To improve our relevance we need to explore the potential in our projects more deeply, deliver research to the public, publish, and collaborate with outside partners to bring in expertise to subjects. This will increase our ‘value’ and allow us to create opportunities for new work, not just wait for it to arrive.</p>
<p>Yesterday I was discussing opportunities to develop applied research projects for robotics in construction with the University of Sydney…Imagine how great it would be to consistently allocate substantial time to developing innovations that you were passionate about. It could be a new model for hospitals, using drones for site specific climatic data collection, exploring the impact of the electric vehicle on our busy streets when we can’t hear or smell cars anymore.</p>
<p>We all need to feel challenged, to drive us to extend our personal boundaries, develop latent talents and explore new possibilities.</p>
<p>Why just predict the future, when we can be part of the future.</p>
<h2>Make good decisions.</h2>
<div class="slide"><img src="./I had a beautiful little jade tree in a white pot… I killed it. _ Tropos_files/good-decisions.jpg" alt="good decisions" /></div>
<p>Once we have a thriving creative climate, we need to consider what we pursue and make good choices.</p>
<p>If we develop an ethical framework, we can act with a ‘well informed conscience’. This should include being clear about what we stand for and who we are.</p>
<p>Every day we are faced with the need to make ethical decisions. As an example, a client might have a great project that delivers a poor outcome for the community–we have to make a decision about whether we pursue the project.</p>
<p>A project is not just a project. If we believe we can be relevant, then we have to accept our actions impact the world in which we inhabit. We have a role to play in shaping our future.</p>
<p>We should be clear on our purpose, our values and our principles.</p>
<p>These should help guide us to make good decisions.</p>
<h2>Go home inspired not tired.</h2>
<div class="slide"><img src="./I had a beautiful little jade tree in a white pot… I killed it. _ Tropos_files/go-home-inspired.jpg" alt="go home inspired" /></div>
<p>Work is only one part of our life.</p>
<p>If we get our climatic conditions right we can all thrive both in shared and individual pursuits.</p>
<p>Our future as architects relies on our ability to continue to be curious, adapt and solve problems creatively. As the rate of change continues to accelerate the way we currently work is becoming unsustainable if we choose to maintain our motivation and relevance.</p>
<p>Rather than throwing out the plant, let’s change the pot and tend to our soil…the rest will follow.</p>

<li><span class="commenter">Chris Bickerton</span>
<p>OK.  I really like this essay, so I’m going to spend some time commenting on this so that I can focus on what I need to do today!  I’d also like to kick off the comments.</p>
<p>A confession: This is the only essay that I have read so far, having been pointed towards this by Ben, after a discussion about the ‘Google’ methodology of working, as I’ve held this method of working close to me throughout my professional career.</p>
<p>I’ve only worked 5 days a week on one thing two times in my entire life – I spent a summer working on a film set back in 2004, and this month will mark the first time that I have spent a full year working 100% for BVN, having spent my first 18 months here also tutoring, and finalising a few side projects that I had riding when I joined.  </p>
<p>What I like about the above proposal (I don’t read it as much as an office of the future, but more so as a DADB proposal, as I see the proposal as more sensible as opposed to futuristic):</p>
<p>1. The provision of a design ‘safety net’ – Under this system I would be able to explore other things, but be able to come back ‘home’ and work in the down periods with relative ease.  I think the ability for increased ‘play’ with less consequence can only be a good thing.</p>
<p>2. A system as such lets a lot of things happen – My thinking about my upcoming DADB proposal is changed significantly if such a system is in place.  The economics of any proposal seem to work a bit better if I have more freedom to allocate my time</p>
<p>3. Dividends = Effort.  I’d not thought of this method of remuneration before, but it seems a fair proposal.  </p>
<p>My questions, which I suppose are of a slightly pragmatic nature:</p>
<p>1. Sanctity of time.    If there is an upcoming deadline, should a project leader be able to encourage/suggest that your time be spent working towards that goal? Or should there be more hard line rules around who can influence how you use your time?   If I choose to spend this research time working on a BVN project, should it be worth the same as my 80%? </p>
<p>2.  Investigating the grey areas.  I would be fascinated to discuss the difference between a project completely outside of BVN, and one of value to the company.  Where does tutoring sit, for example? Surely outside, but what if I was to present my course to BVN?  I could imagine that running a course in say, Rhino modelling and fabrication might be of interest to BVN.  Could it mean that BVN would need to outline key research objectives?  Minimum deliverables? It would be fascinating to work up a framework for the assessment of this.  Would there be a potential for being paid BOTH for external work and research within BVN at the same time?

<p>I really like this post.<br />
I love how enthusiastic and positive it is and the ideas are great and gel with one another.<br />
The analogy underpinning it all I find troubling however; Jade trees are the only plant I have ever been able to keep alive. You couldn’t kill them if you threw them out of your apartment window, drove over them in your car and set them alight, They’re hardier than cactus! What was this person doing with their jade tree?

<li><span class="commenter">Barry Dineen</span>				
<p>I find the 80/20 idea really interesting as something that could easily happen right now. As one possible way to make up the 20% in salary could we have an in-house freelancer style page where specific tasks and research projects could be posted with either a specific value attached or with a bidding system? That way people could compete or bid to work on things that they are specifically interested in. The person in charge of the project or task could decide who to give it to based on budget/skill-set etc. This could potentially encourage people to keep their skills up to date to get the high paying work or if its something new they want to learn they could bid low to try and get some experience in that area. </p>
<p>This could be trialed in our existing structure by people who want to do extra work at the weekends or evenings (quite possible that there might not be any) to make extra cash or learn something new.

<li><span class="commenter">Domino Risch</span>				
<p>This one resonated with me too.
</p>

</li>
<li><span class="commenter">Jesse Lockhart</span>-Krause				
<p>Agreed, a fantastic piece.</p>
<p>Cuts to the heart of what the practices aspirations, a move which supports creativity &amp; innovation is key.
</p>

<li><span class="commenter">Simon Swain</span>				
<p>Agree with optimism. These ideas require further exploration as part of the ‘Architectural Office Of The Future’ vehicle</p>
<blockquote><p>“We need structural change to enable a culture of curiosity and create an environment where everyone is motivated to develop ideas”</p></blockquote>
<p>From a position of reflection and to assist in our own critique of the current BVN ‘culture’, I believe that the Donovan Hill office celerbrated, hoisted events and continually raised paticipant curiosity to enable a creative environment. The culture was evident from within and from outside the studio. It bubbled, it buzzed, it was the life blood of the studio. The culture assisted curiosity, interrogation of norms and historical references, it also enabled us to imagine ‘big’. </p>
<p>I believe that this is an area where DHers (now BVNers) could assist,  foster and enhance our collective culture
