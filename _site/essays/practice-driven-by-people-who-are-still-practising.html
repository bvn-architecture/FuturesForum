    <p>Practices continue to grow and evolve driven by external factors such as time, cost, technology and economy. Yet, other internal factors such as the core traits, skills and principles of individual people have by 2030 come to more strongly drive not only the way in which we work, but practice our profession more broadly. We are not a practice driven by a singular person or figurehead or even a few. We are now a &lt;insert collective noun here&gt; conscious collaboration of people, of architects. We are people influencing not just how people live in the way in which we design the built environment, but our practices now more strongly than ever influence policy and shape society.</p>

<blockquote class="pull">Practices of 2030 will be driven by some of the best educated adults that our society has produced to date.
{:class="pull"}

Generationally, the people who will power the workforce in 2030 have grown up in a more socially conscious, environmentally sustainable era. They critique current practices in policy, efficiency, workflow and society. They call them ‘Millennials’ or Generation Y. Their collective traits are what is pulling practice in many fields in a new direction. Their generational ideologies and aspirations direct not just what work they do, but how they do it. As a cohort they feel collectively ‘special’. They have inculcated a sense of feeling that they are not only important to their parents, but vital to the nation and the world. They are confident. They come with positive solutions for the big problems and they are upbeat about everybody’s future. They play as a team, with a rising sense of civic engagement, yet they are socially liberal. They feel pressure to perform and excel in work and in play. They focus on achievement not merely for themselves; but for others. Practices of 2030 will be driven by some of the best educated adults that our society has produced to date.

These are not traits that have generally been associated with the generations that have come before them. The Silent, Baby Boomers, Gen Xer’s. In fact these core traits have not been seen since the G.I Generation. for those of you who don’t know who they are—they are the ‘Greatest Generation;’. Those who grew up in the time of the Great Depression, and who went on to fight in World War II. Their productivity was integral to the war effort.<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://tropos.bvn.com.au/2015/03/11/16892/#fn-9813-1" id="fnref-9813-1" onclick="return fdfootnote_show(9813)">1</a></sup>

Gen Y’s cultural attitudes, liberal ideals and general positivity to solving problems has led to a more transient and collaborative way in which we work—we practice with an increasing number of “non-architects”, not just those in creative fields either, but those in science, business and economics, particularly humanitarian and developmental fields. The Millennial’s socially conscious, environmentally sustainable way toward the future shapes their lifestyle and work.

<blockquote class="pull">The term think tank has become almost irrelevant
{:class="pull"}

This is a future where people are no longer interested in simply ‘making a donation’, but ‘crowd-funding’ and not just monetary funding either. Practices and industries powered by individuals barter their services, their skills, and their expertise. The increasing prevalence not only of technology but also of social conscious work and encouragement of thought processes outside of the box has led to this diverse manner in which we now come to operate. The term think tank has become almost irrelevant, as each industry practices in thought, each industry works in symbiosis.

Pushing and driving this undercurrent of togetherness and well-being are increasing population and depleting resources. These are issues this generation has grown up acknowledging; and now have the power to address. The consideration of unevenly distributed wealth and the socially conscious way in which this generation was raised has come to have resounding impact on this generation’s sense of civic; and ultimately global, duty. Australia, with one of the fastest growing OECD growth rates in the world, will be coming to terms with aligning economic prosperity with population growth and urban development. By 2061, our cities will all have doubled in size, with 74% of Australians being accommodated within capital cities.<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://tropos.bvn.com.au/2015/03/11/16892/#fn-9813-2" id="fnref-9813-2" onclick="return fdfootnote_show(9813)">2</a></sup> The people and practices of 2030 will be the ones addressing these fundamental changes to our society.

Practice itself, although many will speculate–would become increasingly fragmented with technology enabling many to work from home, will in fact have become even more collaborative. Technology, and its ingrained place with this generation, whom have grown as it has, has the opposite effect. They will utilize this technology as an improved means to collaborate with those overseas and interstate. Better researching and exploring problems and their solutions. Practice with one another will become more collaborative and involved in office at the same time, possibly replicating the way in which our cities have become increasingly congested.

<blockquote class="pull">Millennials …&nbsp;think outside the box&nbsp;…&nbsp;and thus, drive change.
{:class="pull"}

There are examples of more fine grain approaches to this beginning already. These pilots will be expanded upon by these upcoming Millennials, who look to the Gen Xers who have come before them for innovation. Those born under Gen X were (and are!) as a cohort typically sceptical, pragmatic, but with a lack of organised loyalty, always questioning authority (not always a bad thing!) and importantly raised to think globally. Gen X were shaped by events such as dual income parents, the rise of AIDs and HIV, fall of the Berlin Wall, the Chernobyl disaster, the end of apartheid and the birth of the internet<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://tropos.bvn.com.au/2015/03/11/16892/#fn-9813-3" id="fnref-9813-3" onclick="return fdfootnote_show(9813)">3</a></sup>. Their innate qualities have also helped foster the drive of Millennials who have intrinsically come to think outside the box, challenge and question the norm and thus, drive change.

Architectural practice will focus around contemporary cities and our shared spaces, and how we go about implementing these through not only traditional means but new platforms.

Architects will continue to transform urban spaces through playful, political, and participatory interventions, interventions both encouraged and discouraged by policy and power structures. Creative problem solving, use of our cities as an urban laboratories trialling interim studies in the search for longer more substantial change will be frequent. Millennials will seek 21st century solutions to the issues we have been facing since the 18th century. These experimental projects offer new possibilities for occupation, engagement, and development processes within the city on the micro scale, prior to policy induced development<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://tropos.bvn.com.au/2015/03/11/16892/#fn-9813-4" id="fnref-9813-4" onclick="return fdfootnote_show(9813)">4</a></sup>. Projects may originate in new and organic means based on funding and support, a slow conglomeration of resources; both resources of skill and those fiscal.

Guerrilla or grass-roots approaches to design, lead to wider acceptance of new and innovative solutions to larger problems, with power structures able to see strategies implemented as a success, prior to investing extraordinary capital. Ideas such those trialled by raumlaborberlin at Tempelhof in Germany<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://tropos.bvn.com.au/2015/03/11/16892/#fn-9813-5" id="fnref-9813-5" onclick="return fdfootnote_show(9813)">5</a></sup> or Marcus Newbury<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://tropos.bvn.com.au/2015/03/11/16892/#fn-9813-6" id="fnref-9813-6" onclick="return fdfootnote_show(9813)">6</a></sup> of Renew Newcastle fame are prime examples. Raumlabourberlin engaged with citizens of the city, were investing them as “pioneers” to act as agents or stewards for the site<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://tropos.bvn.com.au/2015/03/11/16892/#fn-9813-7" id="fnref-9813-7" onclick="return fdfootnote_show(9813)">7</a></sup> in a series of installations. These exquisite design solutions have led to broader funding and reuse of previously dilapidated spaces. The work of Marcus Newbury investigates combining culture, art and urban planning to stimulate the business economy<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://tropos.bvn.com.au/2015/03/11/16892/#fn-9813-8" id="fnref-9813-8" onclick="return fdfootnote_show(9813)">8</a></sup>. He has since been brought on by Victorian Government to look at similar strategies at the Docklands. These pilots better integrate people and architectural development, inherently allowing for the adoption of successful longer term development. Approaches such as those in Tempelhof in Berlin, or Newcastle, whereby a single architect or person approaches social or political issues with the seed of a design solution, are examples of the need for this generations socially-engaged conscience to utilize their skills in spatial practice to manoeuvre between the scales of the street level and the power structures above.

This individualistic mentality of those power housing the workforce of 2030, makes it logical that those within practice would utilize their skills rather than their cash flow for the greater good. Social consciousness along with open mindedness, a love of travel and experienced based development all plays into how Millennials work and operate. While they are motivated by individual and personal gains, and often accosted by news media for being ‘selfish’; gains can also be local and global with this mentality. A win-win system is implemented. Time may be donated to <em>pro-bono</em> projects in local communities, or expertise offered to larger organised aid faculties. An architect’s expertise in planning, should be utilised in conjunction with government organisation and policy making when considering future cities development. Why is this not yet the case? Being motivated by others perception; still results in good being generated. This mentality of the Millennial collective allows for practice to be about the people, both those working in the field and those who are served by it. Practice driven from the inside rather than by external forces such as time and financial pressure is on the cusp of occurring thanks to the Millenials traits.

<blockquote class="pull">working closely with power structures, collaborating with architects and non-architects alike
{:class="pull"}

While Governments always will have a role in designing and planning from a precinct level, architects will by this stage be better ingrained within planning controls and policy making for current and future development. Practice of 2030, will more than likely have adopted this model of utilizing pioneering ideas such as those mentioned previously as a means for encouraging socially conscious and participative solutions to bigger questions and issues, working closely with power structures, collaborating with architects and non-architects alike.

Bespoke agreements between councils, central governments with consultation from architects, engineers, scientists and economists could be utilized to transform how governments plan and build our cities, as well as fund them. This is something currently being explored in the UK City Deals program. The Cities Policy Unit was created for this purpose in August 2011. It is made up of civil servants and staff seconded from local government, think tanks and the private sector. It works jointly with the Department for Business Innovation and Skills and the Department for Communities and Local Government. These multifaceted policies which branch across various sectors, implemented from above ensure that those best equipped with knowledge, skills and expertise can plan for how public money may best be utilized, take charge of decisions for their local area and create future economic growth<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://tropos.bvn.com.au/2015/03/11/16892/#fn-9813-9" id="fnref-9813-9" onclick="return fdfootnote_show(9813)">9</a></sup>.

We are problem solvers, born and then designed to think critically. We have skills to solve many of the world’s long standing problems and questions with pragmatic and considered answers. In practising using our skills in new and unusual ways we further ourselves, our profession, the lives of others and our practices. It will be those Millenials in the firms of today; currently practicing and learning, who come to define architectural practice of the future. They will do so driven by their collective desire to do good, not simply for themselves, their ego, their Facebook feed or Instagram account–but their inculcated need to help others.
