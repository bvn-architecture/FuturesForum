    <p>To begin to define what this could be, one must reflect upon the factors which make an architectural office now.</p>
<p>So…what defines an office of architecture? The typical categorisation of an architectural practice focuses on the number of practising architects. The standard analysis also uses size, number of offices, global location etc… as factors. Statistics can be misleading as they do not take into account other variables. The amount of hours worked, social scene and employee satisfaction are all aspects ignored by this method of analysis. Including the skill base and specialist knowledge that certain practices grow to achieve. For the collaboration with other companies or practices that take place. For example an office may have 50 employees; who only work within a 100 mile radius, working 9-5 hours and projects specialised into purely one sector. Another company of equal size may have a few offices or collaborate on a global scale. The hours worked may vary significantly and the social scene may also be enhanced and supported by the company, carrying out various sector work.</p>
<p>So far few conclusions have been drawn about an accurate method of defining an architectural practice. However an idea of defining a practice by any physical factors leads to a misrepresentation of the actual office itself. The observation that the biggest architectural practice with the highest number of qualified architects is the best is just not true.</p>
<p>In this essay I will be exploring the position of the architect. The relationship between the person, their roles and the ‘archetypal architects’ office’. Also external factors that help shape a practice both physically and demographically. My conclusions will lead onto future considerations for an ‘office’ and how architects and designers could begin to think about the title ‘architect’ and the emphasis placed on the terminology we use.</p>
<p>An Architect…?</p>
<p>Google the word and you get about 232,000,000 results in 0.31 seconds. The description explaining the role and responsibility of an architect is dry being:</p>
<blockquote><p>“…a person who plans, designs, and oversees the construction of buildings. To practice architecture means to provide services in connection with the design and construction of buildings and the space within the site surrounding the buildings, that have as their principal purpose human occupancy or use.”</p></blockquote>
<p>The role of an architect used to be very different. The title held a position of respect and prestige. This has not been completely lost today, but the roles and responsibilities have ebbed and altered. There are now builders, structural engineers, electrical consultants, quantity surveyors, project managers etc. All terms to describe new roles taken by additional 3rd parties which used to come under the banner of ‘architect’.</p>
<p>The term architect is now also being adopted by various sectors outside the construction industry. You see ‘cloud architects, solutions architects, IT architects etc. All dealing with virtual platforms and software. Something you cannot physically hold in your hand. This raises the question: ‘is architecture purely about the physical?’ Might the film Inception have a point with their ‘dream architects’? Does the virtual world, with advances in technology, become more of an influencing factor in shaping the way we live, inhabit buildings and interact with the world around us?</p>
<p>I must note that I am taking nothing away from those who have done 7 or more years at university and in practices. To go through each stage and emerge fully qualified into the world of work is a great achievement. Well done and congratulations to all who have! To come into the industry and begin again at the bottom of the ladder is tough! It is however the best way to learn and gain a good understanding and knowledge of all aspects of the design process. Working up from small scale tasks to the full responsibility of job running and creation of the built form. Roles of an architect on a project can vary and may even be reduced to a consultant role offering technical advice, or site delivery rather than any form of design role. This leads onto another idea which will be explored later – which is that the term ‘designer’ may be more apt to future descriptions of an architect’s role.</p>
<p>Some traits appear to be required by an architect or lead designer that go beyond that of purely design and construction. For example; they must be a salesman, winning the client over to not only their scheme but convincing them that they are the right person for the job. A design can do so much but people buy people. A problem solver and critical thinker who has the knowledge to look for and find solutions to any problems or constraints that arise. Whether through the client during briefing stage, site constraints – programme delays for weather etc. – and construction constraints on site if the builder has neglected to place an order and now the chosen product is not available in the correct quantities. A team player as all the decisions made are formed from interactions and conversations with the rest of the design team. The designer has to be adaptable to change, but also focused enough not to lose sight of the end goal and design intent. An element of psychology with an understanding of people is also a useful characteristic especially during the briefing stage with the client, ensuring the right questions are asked leading to a greater understanding of the specific needs and requirements. Technical knowledge of construction, which builds over time can then be applied to tailor each design decision just enough to be bespoke for the client yet standard enough (panel sizes etc…) not to blow the construction budget and help with the ease of the build. The logic of a mathematician must sit side by side with that of an artist when working through a scheme from concept to completion, bound together by a strong passion and determination to satisfy the client (first and foremost), the design team and the various subcontractors involved! Phew!</p>
<p>…In theory, the office could be a lab, a studio, a classroom, a retreat etc. This is why the definition of an architect’s studio is difficult one! Physical analysis is too constrained, how can you measure and quantify the qualities mentioned above?</p>
<p>I’ve indicated how an office should not be defined. I should start to offer up some solutions or options for what the office could be. The social human aspect of the office, hours worked, size and speciality could be a few so let’s explore these now.</p>
<p>Observing the social aspect of a practice, and speaking from personal experience of work and life, it is the people that make a space or workplace. We spend more time awake at work, working or in the office during the week than we do anywhere else! The people around you and your working environment has a huge impact on your daily life. When you leave a place it is the people that you miss. People are the reason buildings are designed. Their happiness and satisfaction is paramount to the buildings success. The work-life balance is crucial; with employers understanding the designers who work for them and their needs. The flexibility of the demands of the job. The extracurricular activities, offering social activities or further learning opportunities to boost morale being of utmost importance for satisfaction and a productive workforce.</p>
<p>This analysis leads onto hours worked. Again this differs between people – the productivity level and working thresholds vary. To be able to account for this and still maintain a happy practice is the ultimate goal. Lessons learned from the past will definitely be a factor in the offices of the future.</p>
<p>A final definition from those proffered in the earlier paragraph was that of size. The size of a practice could indicate success in both a commercial achievement and also staff welfare and satisfaction of their workplace for the company. A good practice will grow, maintaining its appeal to the best in the business. There could come a point where the practice is too large. Staff members feeling lost and under-appreciated. This is where a management structure will keep it strong. You could be anywhere in the world but still feel part of something larger, bigger and connected.</p>
<p>External factors are extra variables which can affect any office. The location, economic developments and technology advancements are all components which plug into the daily life of a workplace. They affect not only how tasks are performed but also with who, and how many people can do it.</p>
<p>The effects of location are an obvious factor to think about. I won’t dwell long on this as it places too great an importance on the physical aspect of a practice. This commentary is focusing on an office, but does not believe it should be constrained by walls or location etc… As previously mentioned it is the people and quality of these which effect the office. If the workplace is in the middle of nowhere then less people would physically be able to get there but do they need to be physically present all the time? To define an architectural office physically misses out on the true essence of the studio.</p>
<p>Another global factor which does impact an office is the economy. Most of us lived through at least one recession. The effect it has on not only the work done but amount of employees that can be retained during the difficult times. An economic recession is like doomsday for the construction industry. The impact is felt for a lot longer than other businesses which are more adaptable than building trade. Although new and unique challenges are thrown up during this time; the loss of colleagues, morale dip, dramatic shift in product availability and prices all leads to unease. It is out of the control of any project manager, practice director or lead architect and to survive there must be adaptability. This adaptability will be required in a future office.</p>
<p>Finally technology is a tool which can allow a greater collaboration globally. It can increase efficiency and allow many more people to connect / work / design in ways that we considered unachievable before. The tools provided are useful; the computer literate will advance and adapt. Having the skill to harness this and learn the capabilities of the new processes will help enable a better more cohesive design flow. The emphasis on the architect could lessen – the role of the technical whizz kid could increase. It is crucial to be open minded and attempt to understand as much as possible. With a greater knowledge comes a greater understanding, not only of design time, design capabilities and production of information etc. Harnessing this can be another outlet for creativity as the developments of a building can be dramatically enhanced through the use of certain programs. We can create built forms that could only be concept or take years to design. An individual’s efficiency can also increase leaving more time for the concept creation time. Technology also allows multi-site locations for an office whilst still maintaining a feeling of connectivity for all staff members, social media, staff intranet etc. These morale boosting technologies allow a community feel for each member of the practice.</p>
<p>In conclusion, I believe that the role of an architect will change. (Purposefully not defining an architectural office by any physical constraints.) There are many other consultants already shaping and defining buildings. The building regulations and guidelines create extra constraints when constructing a space. Those constraints leave fewer areas of opportunity for freedom. I am not saying this is always a negative. The role of the architect becomes more like a designer day by day. In my own experience, interior architects and designers often get a lot more freedom than architects on daily tasks and projects. This presents the question of titles and role definition.</p>
<p>It is also important to remember that the lead on a project may not always be an architect. Depending on the type of construction contract this could be anyone. We are seeing more and more collaborative approaches to design. For example fashion designers constructing interior spaces. There has always been the cross over in architecture between buildings, furniture, lighting etc. Now the flow is starting to move the other way too. Again, thinking back to how an architectural office of the future will emerge, this will be influenced by the role of an ‘architect’.</p>
<p>The architectural office of the future may lose the term ‘architect’ altogether. Becoming more of a design hub or atelier. A collaboration consortium of various specialities in their chosen field! Each group would plug in where appropriate. Design processes and principles are similar across the spectrum of design.</p>
