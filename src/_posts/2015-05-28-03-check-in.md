Check-in will happen when you get on a coach, or at the wharf if you are driving. Your bags will be tagged at check-in. 

Your rooms have already been allocated and your bags will be delivered to your rooms on arrival on the island. Keys will be distributed on the ferry.

This means that you don't need to carry your luggage around all day. It also means that you won't see your bag until 17:30, so if there's anything you will need during the day then keep it on you.

Keep your eyes peeled for dolphins!
