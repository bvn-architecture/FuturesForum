Check in will occur upon transfer from either the Creek Street studio or Brisbane domestic airport. 

Your rooms have been pre-allocated and staff from Tangalooma will tag your bags as you board the coach for transfer to Holt Street Wharf.

Your bags will be delivered to your rooms on arrival on the island.
