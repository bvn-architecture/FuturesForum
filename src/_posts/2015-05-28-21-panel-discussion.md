Simon Longstaff picks up the baton from Ben with this session. It will continue the discussion of the Big Questions, but broaden the scope to include the topics from Thursday's keynotes.

Simon will chair a panel discussion with all the guest speakers to draw out how the Big Questions relate to their particular areas of expertise.
