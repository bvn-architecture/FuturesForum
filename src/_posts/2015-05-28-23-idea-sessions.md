This is your chance to spend a solid chunk of time with one of our five speakers. Each of them is going to run a workshop. It'll allow you to get deep into the ideas that they developed in their keynotes, and it will be a chance to integrate the points that have come up in *all* the sessions so far.

Hold off making your mind up about which speaker you'd like to go with until you've seen the keynotes and heard the panel discussion.
