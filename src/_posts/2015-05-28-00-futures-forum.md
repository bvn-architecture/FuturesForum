Welcome to the Futures Forum!

This two day event is the beginning of a new way of working at BVN. We are about ideas and about shaping the future.

This event is the culmination of all the warmup events and activities that have happened over the last 6 months. You can see the results of all of them by pressing **menu** and going to the event in question.
