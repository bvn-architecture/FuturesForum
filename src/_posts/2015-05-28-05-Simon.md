Here's what The Ethics centre websie says about him:

> Dr Simon Longstaff AO
> Simon’s distinguished career includes being named as one of AFR Boss True Leaders for the 21st century with Carol Schwartz noting "…I don’t know one CEO or chairman in corporate Australia who has not worked with Simon Longstaff". Simon has a PhD in Philosophy from Cambridge. Prior to becoming the inaugural Executive Director of The Ethics Centre in 1991, he worked in the Northern Territory in the Safety Department of BHP subsidiary, GEMCO, lectured at Cambridge University and consulted to the Cambridge Commonwealth and Overseas Trusts. Simon was inaugural President of The Australian Association for Professional & Applied Ethics and is a Fellow of the World Economic Forum. He is Chairman of the International Advisory Board of the Genographic Project and Deputy Chairman of the Global Reporting Initiative Board. He also serves on a number of Boards and Committees across a broad spectrum of activities in Australia.
 
The ethics centre (formerly the St James Ethics Centre) is entirely independent from the church. It is now a secular organisation that provides an open forum for the promotion and exploration of ethical questions.
