Welcome to Futures Forum

We're here to think about the future. Life moves too fast to let the future just come to us. You need to be actively working to keep up and we want to be at the front of the pack!

We have a full programme. We'd love it if you could help out by being on time for things. That means being in the right place 10 minutes before something starts, and then in your seats right on time.

First things first. James is going to welcome everyone to the Futures Forum under the flensing deck. **X** marks the spot.

The wifi network in the flensing deck is called *Tangalooma Conference* and the password is *Tangalooma1*
