This is what he says about himself on his LinkedIn page:

>In 2009 I moved to Berlin to contribute to this vibrant city. I work as an event initiator, writer and moderator in the field of design. I was a guest professor at both the Berlin design faculties (WeiÃŸensee & UDK). I worked with organizations such as 'Design and Government', DMY, International Design Zentrum and Palomar5. 

>I founded a design office in 1996. We designed projects for different governmental bodies. Some mapping projects (such as Randstad and Nieuwe Kaart) and public spaces.Quite some projects were self-initiated. Schie was a typical example of the nineties Dutch Design attitude, as described in 'Superdutch' and 'Artificial landscape'. 

>In 2001 I moved to Premsela, Dutch platform for design. I worked as a program-manager. In 2005 I changed to the Academy for Architecture and Urban design in Rotterdam. I was the Dean (director) until 2009. I started a magazine (Huig) and initiated masterclasses for urban-planners. With students we researched the impact of Olympic games on cities, which ended in a show in the Dutch Architecture Institute (Nai). I co-founded a Design platform in Rotterdam (dpfr.nl), that still exist. We stage discussions and meetings for professionals in the creative industry. 

>I have been writing during my whole career, for online and offline architecture and design magazines such as Dezeen, Items, Archis, SR & O, and Archined. Some of the articles are on my blog. I have moderated many discussions and sessions in the field of my work. I interviewed designers and architects in public. Some of those the interviews are on my blog as well.

>I train people in public speaking and communicating, in designschools (such as Design Academy Eindhoven and Royal Academy of Art, The Hague) and in private settings. Most of the customers work in design and innovation. With others I taught in winter-courses on Moderation.

>Specialties:Moderating and Interviewing on design, architecture and innovation.
