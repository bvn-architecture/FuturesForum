<p class="introduction"><strong>Abstract:</strong> Put simply In 15 year’s time, the Architectural Office (and practice in general) will be one in which the most progressive firms have completed a strategic pivot (shift in their core business) from Building Information Modelling (BIM) to People Information Modelling (PIM)<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://tropos.bvn.com.au/2015/03/11/pim-and-the-living-lab/#fn-9818-2" id="fnref-9818-2" onclick="return fdfootnote_show(9818)">2</a></sup>. The rationale for the shift can be summarized in the following 8 points<sup class="footnote"><a href="http://tropos.bvn.com.au/2015/03/11/pim-and-the-living-lab/#fn-9818-3" id="fnref-9818-3" onclick="return fdfootnote_show(9818)">3</a></sup>:</p>

<li>It will be an extension of a historical progression we can already see taking place; from a preoccupation with form as Architecture’s primary concern (modernism/20thC +prior) to the current preoccupation with environment (habitat, space, urban realm) as architecture’s primary concern.</li>
<li>This current condition of environmental concern has the paradoxical effect of creating a more anthropocentric (human centred) approach to design; as clients + the public in general gain a greater awareness of the effect of environment on themselves physiologically.</li>
<li>This heightened physiological awareness will come primarily from the increase in digital surveillance + wearable technology which easily measures, analyses (and often shares through cloud and IoT) personal bio-metric data such as heart rate variability, skin conductivity, pupil dilation, salival cortisol (stress hormone) levels and much more.</li>
<li>These biometric markers (many of which directly relate to wellbeing and stress levels) can dramatically change in response to a persons’ environs, the current fascination with the data and the technology itself (smart watches, phones, smart TVs, web cams, etc.) will soon progress to an interest in how the environment changes the data (i.e. health of the person) for better or worse.</li>
<li>This is the point at which Architects will/must situate themselves in the future; As smart spatial practitioners who (in response to such datasets) can manipulate space in real time/near to real time in such a way that it will have demonstrable impacts on people’s bio-metric data that can be seen instantly experienced + analysed, with the space itself being refined again based on the data (this process continues indefinitely).</li>
<li>This process is known as bio-feedback; used in scientific physiological research for decades, its only relationship with Architecture currently is that it is loosely analogous to some parametric design processes (mainly relating to form rather than user experience). it is also used in some building services systems (e.g C02 monitoring) at a bulk occupant level. In the future however, true physical Architectural bio-feedback loops will be as normative as ESD is today.</li>
<li>An example—an Architect in the future is engaged to fit out a workplace for a law firm; Rather than leave the client after construction services, the architect designs the space to a point where it can be occupied and business engaged. The architect then monitors workers bio-metric data for positive + negative trends of the occupants and continually redesigns elements within the space for the duration of the tenancy (decades if necessary). The law firm uses this process as the primary component of their overall wellbeing strategy to attract + retain staff. The best Architects are the ones who can maintain bio-metrics which continue to trend positively through constant refinement of the elements which affect those markers (light, sound, air ergonomics, way finding etc)</li>
<li>This sees consumers themselves (workers, patients, punters, clients, whatever you want to call them) as the primary engine of space creation, rather than passive subjects whose comfort is important but (by and large) is not really seriously measured or quantified in any meaningful way.</li>
