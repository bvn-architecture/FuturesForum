<p>Following the national studio meeting and LEAN workshop, my focus was on what the architecture / design profession sells, what sets it apart from other professions and professionals, defining this and considering a possibility of what an AOOTF could be based on this…</p>
<ol>
<li>What do we sell?<br>
We sell our imagination; we practice creativity<br>
We sell our skill to realise our (or a client’s) imagination by means of producing and monitoring a set of instructions</li>
<li>Definitions of what we sell
<div class="dic-definition">
<p><span class="word">Imagination</span> (definition, Oxford Dictionary):</p>
<ul>
<li>The faculty or action of forming new ideas, or images or concepts of external objects not present to the senses</li>
<li>The ability of the mind to be creative or resourceful</li>
<li>The part of the mind that imagines things</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="dic-definition">
<p><span class="word">Creativity</span> (definition, Oxford Dictionary):</p>
<ul>
<li>The use of imagination or original ideas to create something;&nbsp;Inventiveness</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="dic-definition">
<p><span class="word">Skill</span>(definition, Oxford Dictionary):</p>
<ul>
<li>The ability to do something well; expertise</li>
<li>A particular ability</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="dic-definition">
<p><span class="word">Produce</span> (definition, Oxford Dictionary):</p>
<ul>
<li>Make or manufacture from components or raw materials</li>
<li>Make (something) using creative skills</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="dic-definition">
<p><span class="word">Realise</span> (definition, Oxford Dictionary):</p>
<ul>
<li>Cause to happen</li>

<div class="dic-definition">
<p><span class="word">Instructions</span> (definition, Oxford Dictionary):</p>
<ul>
<li>Detailed information about how something should be done or operated</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>Feeding the creative soul is important. There is a magic in creating something. It gives our profession purpose. Having somewhere to express, test and learn from our imagination is vital to realise and develop ideas and practice creativity.</li>
<li>LaboratoryWorkshopPlayroomSchoolGalleryLibraryStudio (not office): A space to nurture the creative soul and imagination
<ul>
<li>It’s a workshop, because we build physical things and ideas and hone our skills</li>
<li>It’s a playroom, because we have fun</li>
<li>It’s a laboratory, because we produce useable objects</li>
<li>It’s a school, because we learn things</li>
<li>It’s a gallery, because we display and critique what we have built and produced</li>
<li>It’s a studio, because we do the above in an artful way</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Leave it to technology to document our imagination<br>
We could be modelling with real stuff with software that documents instructions from which to build.<p></p>

Just as the example above relies on large block (Lego Duplo), a system is being developed for regular Lego pieces such as Lego Architecture studio<br>

What if, similar to how pixel technology has developed over the past 15 years and where it’s heading,</p>

<p>Lego blocks are&nbsp;replaced with kinetic sand or plasticine?<br>

<li>Scope – what does this look like?<br>
Just as a construction site is our office, our AOOTF could not resemble a traditional office as we know it. For example, if you don’t count the builder’s site office, there are no desks on a construction site.<br>

Do we need to reflect a corporate conservatism at all? Why? Our profession is inherently based on creativity. Is it a less orchestrated space? Can we have a meeting on the floor or leaning against a wall?<br>
The AOOTF could enable ourselves to go to work to investigate, create, play, perfect, learn and admire every day when you feel the need to.</li>
<li>How could this AOOTF operate?<br>
Foster spontaneity with ‘bump’ / chance meetings with other colleagues to expand the richness and quality of our collective imagination. Nurture ‘core’ purpose. At all hours?<br>

</ol>
<p>Does it fall under the banner of BVN, not necessarily under the BVN brand? Can it be trialled within the current studio as a secondment?<br>
Do we hold classes and invite external / community participation and learning?</p>

<p>I totally support this idea of a culture and environment that nutures creativity and enables experiments.

<p>Excellent! Lets do it.</p>
<p>I tend to always fall back to the vision of designing, attending meetings and all the other tasks being within a projected workshop environment or wearing an occulus like apparatus. Everything is recorded real time, no need to write or sketch everything into a formal document. Its simply compiled and filtered over time and fashioned into the brand. The technology tracks progress and manages all forms of information. This allows more time to test and develop the creative aspects. </p>
<p>Question: Given the small percentage of design and creativity that occurs in the current day process and that many Architectural roles rely on being more the communicators, recorders and facilitators, will there be the room or demand for all of us to foster a purely creative and imaginative position?</p>
<p>Like the industrial age and information age has eliminated a lot of people skilled processes, I think the answer lies in recognising that the skills always require a paradigm shift to survive. Thus far, as a practice, it has.

<p>I’d imagine thered be some kind of critical mass for it to continue. I’m sure theres a study somewhere.

<p>To this  “will there be the room or demand for all of us to foster a purely creative and imaginative position?”</p>
<p>I believe that it depends on collective priorities and how we reconfigure and enable ourselves. For example DHers are familar with design(close to the ‘imaginative’) permiating most facets of practice. Including the mundane ones. This results in the majority of actions and communications being strategic to enable something. Lests say in this regard maybe it was for the best architectural or design outcome. This is was a focus and everyone got in behind this.</p>
<p>We could reinterrogate this idea by saying – Is everyone currently getting in behind and supporting a collective focus for the future at BVN? Is focus or purpose required. Does everyone need to care? or can this work with only a minority?</p>
<p>If the collective wanted imagniation (or other) to be the priorty then whats stopping us?
