<p>The Architectural Profession is at risk of having its voice drowned out if it does not move away from its reactionary position. The all-encompassing power of the Architect has been slowly diluted over the past century, yet the importance of their role as shapers of the modern city has never been so high. The profession is delicately poised moving into an era of rapid technological change. The way in which today’s profession will be able to evolve and keep its relevance moving toward 2030 is extremely pertinent.</p>
<p>Rather than speculate directly on the technological or design future, I am interested in looking at where I see architectural studios sitting within the changing context of the architectural profession. As the role of the profession grows in breadth, design studios should move toward a position of greater specialisation and collaboration, rather than attempting to touch all bases. I believe in doing so, the architectural profession safeguards itself from becoming fully subservient to rapidly evolving external environments. This will allow studios to be better equipped at responding to the broadening of the architectural context.</p>
<p>The studios ability to sustain a level of innovation is limited by the professions reliance on external market forces. Too often the ‘well-being’ and scope of innovation within studios is susceptible to the timeless rollercoaster ride of financial cycles. Globally, the last ten years has shown that architecture firms, across a range of sizes, have had to fight between themselves for limited opportunities. This is primarily through under cutting of fees, rather than ‘better design’. Given this, the first items to give way are chiefly the intangibles- the research, investment in new systems and progression into under-developed innovations. These represent the very same items that can be used to safeguard the practice on the next downward swing</p>
<p>The survival of an Architecture Studio is largely down to its ability to win work and then to design, document and oversee construction. The all-encompassing manner in which the majority of studios operate means that:</p>
<blockquote><p>No Investment in Built Form = No Architectural Practice.</p></blockquote>
<p>The designer’s perspective is that they are one of the few professions that can improve people’s lives on a day to day basis. This is no doubt true, but in order to do so, there needs to be a move toward a model of practicing that shows greater resilience to these external factors.</p>

<p>The world is witnessing a shift toward more holistic thought processes with deeper outcomes. The future leaders are going through a system where undergraduate degrees are broader, and post graduate degrees are a pre-requisite to explore deeper. Similarly, leading design firms, such as SHoP Architects are using a multi-disciplinary standpoint to their advantage. Understanding architecture to be ‘the last great generalist profession’, they explain that “we really cared about theory and history and culture and beauty but we also really cared about politics and finance and technology and how those could come together”. This has allowed them to invest time and energy into the fabrication of materials and into their projects financially- a show of faith toward their own intellectual property. It is in part owing to this that their forward thinking investment has allowed them greater freedom in doing what architects do best- realising the transformative potential of the built environment.</p>

<p>The manner in which ‘Architecture’ will shape the world will only grow with the challenges that will be posed in the future. SHoP is an outstanding model of grasping this changing architectural discourse, however, the scope and variation in how this will be achieved, will render the ability to cover the whole scope of the profession unsustainable for a single studio. Practices of the future must carve out their own spaces in this broader future as a way of securing the profession a future to shape the world.</p>

<p>The practice of the future must move away from a centralized, all-encompassing skill set and towards a refined area of expertise. The greater adaptability this will bring, will allow the profession to respond to the broadening of the professions role. Although not touching specifically on technology changes, it is important to note the role of Artificial Intelligence. As areas of architecture begin to be passed outside of human hands, it will only highlight the need for us to dig deeper in order to push past the new automated norm. These areas of expertise, or smaller fields of interest, rather than examine certain architectural typologies, will vary between the physical and virtual world. Not all studios will be focussed on delivering the built form, but will work in conjunction with other studios. As the process of superseding begins, it will be up to the practices to be constantly evolving within these fields to stay ahead of the general curve. The only way this can happen is through consistent research, we should not simply practice what we have learnt, yet develop new ideas by working from a position of strength and competitive advantage.</p>

<p>The movement toward specialisation does not mean that architects will lose their breadth of thought and design from an isolated viewpoint. The push toward collaborative workflow, within the architectural office and wider society, allows for intellectual problems to be understood across a greater breadth of viewpoints. Arguably, collaboration within architecture studios does not reach its full potential because the majority of the voices are singing from the same hymn sheet. The future model, will allow studios to offer and be offered more value as collaborators- intensifying the position and breadth of understanding. It is when all of these architectural or design minded ‘consultants’ come together that there is a potential for greater collaborative outcomes. People with very specific areas of expertise, yet a broad overarching background within the same framework. It could be likened to the recent move toward earlier engagement between architects and consultants, one that although at times challenging, is generally accepted to produce improved outcomes. This broad framework that fits under the realm of architecture can be chopped and changed where needed as the task requires. It also gives rise to the potential that the studios can practice outside of the traditional architectural realm. The large practice of today will be seen as clunky, as the broad thinking of one office, will be inferior to the in-depth thinking of many. This will allow the profession of tomorrow to have the best opportunity to continue in the dialogue of the greater architectural landscape.</p>

<p>This passage has argued that the architectural practice needs to become more specific in its focus, while architecture as a profession becomes wider in its scope. This was introduced as a response to what I believe to be the reactionary nature of the practice of architecture in the current environment. Further, it explored how the breadth and variation within architecture will render it impossible for practices to be across all facets in a world which will crave details. Finally, rather than ‘specialisation’ leading to architecture designed in silos, there will be more meaningful collaboration across the architectural realm- as opposed to collaboration between largely like-minded parties. This is my practice of the future, the collaborative practice, working in an architectural profession of greater depth and far greater breadth. Will the profession look like this?</p>
<p>Probably not- but its good fun speculating on.</p>

		<p>I had to read this a couple of times to get my head around the idea. I thought that a good way of checking that I understand it might be to summarise it.</p>
		<p>We have the same struggle for relevance that has shown up in nearly all the other essays–the concern that at some point in the future we’ll no longer be the apex predator of the construction/property industry. This essay seems to lay the blame for this squarely at the feet of the architecture profession. (I agree with this reasoning.) Citing competition and differentiation on fee rather than offering to be the root cause.</p>
		<p>I think that the claim that Architects “are one of the few professions that can improve people’s lives on a day to day basis” is a bit hubristic. That said I think that it’s just an oddly constructed intro to an important set of points. I feel like the author is posing the idea of being the ‘last great generalist profession’ as a straw man ripe for the slaughter (to painfully mix metaphors).</p>
		<p>What is described as the SHoP model actually fits quite well with my understanding of how science is done these days. Half a century ago people like Hooke and Wren could make significant contributions to physics, architecture, cosmology, biology and probably a heap of other fields. They made these contributions because the fields were shallow and the new weapon of the scientific method was powerful at mopping up all the obvious mistakes that their forebearers had made. My understanding is that this piece argues that architecture has reached the end of the period where great contributions are made by heroic individuals. This new period requires people–most probably groups of people–who are specifically skilled in a way that allows them to solve very specific problems.</p>
		<p>This is hinted at by the <a href="http://blogs.bvn.com.au/tropos/2015/02/17/16672/" title="Synthesis" rel="nofollow">Synthesis </a>essay, with its call for a “conductor” but this essay goes deeper into the implications. The conductor doesn’t play any instruments, the instruments are played by the specialist teams.</p>
		<p>I’d imagine that a lot of you see this as quite dystopian. You probably take pride in being a generalist. I see it as inevitable that sooner or later generalism will require people to stop ‘doing’ in a way that will move the attribution of status onto the specialists. (Maybe it’s already here and we just aren’t acknowledging it?)</p>
