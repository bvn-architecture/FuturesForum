<h2>The Year 2050:</h2>
<p>In 2049 the last 100 architects in Australia adopted “The Architects’ Manifesto” following the decimation of the architecture profession through market predation led by massive companies including Lend Lease, AECOM and CBRE, who took over the roles of designing and documenting buildings from a profession that had become too feeble to fight back.</p>
<p>The aim of the Architects Manifesto is to involve every architect in the development of a vibrant and compelling architecture culture in their community.</p>
<p>This is seen as being the only way that the value of architecture will be realized and will be able to stand on its own as vital to the community’s well-being as medicine, law, science and the fine arts.</p>
<div class="manifesto">
<h1>The Architects Manifesto:</h1>
<ol>
<li>All architects must develop communication skills</li>
<li>All architecture talks must be developed for public consumption</li>
<li>All architecture associations, institutes and such like must have membership open to the public</li>
<li>All architecture processes must be filmed and broadcast online</li>
<li>All architecture websites must include the latest films on the latest projects</li>
<li>All architects must give at least one public talk each year</li>
<li>All architects must seek opportunities to talk to news media about issues concerning the built environment</li>
<li>All architects must initiate at least one event in their local community each year, this may be: a tour of local architecture, an exhibition, a film showing, or something even more compelling</li>
<li>All architects must visit their local schools and put on an architectural event for the students once a year</li>
<li>All architecture awards results must be announced in the general media and online and the winners are required to explain their award winning projects to as many people as possible, preferably on a national television programme. Any winner who does not comply with this directive will have their award withdrawn, as without communication, the award is useless.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The architecture office of the future will need to have communication embedded in its business DNA. Only by ensuring that all architects are engaged in a broad and active communication programme will architecture be valued and sought after by those seeking to improve the built environment.</p>

			<p>I’d love to see this happen. So much of what we currently pass off as ‘communication’ is really words used as a weapon to confuse people.</p>
<p>I actually like all the ‘must’s in here. I’d imagine that a lot of people think “that sounds like too much work, I’m too busy to do that”. If we really did do all these things then the monetary value of projects would go up as the public starts to see the value that we–privately–gripe about them not seeing. That would mean that each person would need to do less work to maintain a similar lifestyle. </p>
<p>With people doing less work for more money there would be space for more people to do the job. We’d need this as we attracted more young bright things through all the visibility we’d generated!
