<p>The future of our practice and craft begins now,</p>
<p>It is the responsibility of thou.</p>
<p>I’m not talking space ships, LED’s and special effects,</p>
<p>We’re looking at those issues concerning the global population, whom we really affect.</p>
<p>There have been many brilliant pieces of art and prose,</p>
<p>Held up as shining examples, completed by unknown those.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is the future I see,</p>
<p>Where practicing is not about a single project; or a star-chitect or three.</p>
<p>It is a big shock! I know! I know!</p>
<p>But think of it as a chance for us all to grow.</p>
<p>Some worry that in future with those in building we cannot compete;</p>
<p>Some fear our craft being shipped offshore &amp; becoming obsolete.</p>
<p>But; to those I say—never fear my friend,</p>
<p>You don’t get into this business simply to construct &amp; mend!</p>
<p>Thanks to a fruit, we can create and collaborate together or apart,</p>
<p>These new type of projects we will be delving into are not those where the client is the start.</p>
<p>People may work on guerrilla projects,</p>
<p>Using their skills to solve the issues that policy neglects.</p>
<p>Architecture becomes about the seed or idea,</p>
<p>A new way of thinking &amp; considering problems, and not just those in Eritrea!</p>
<p>Because really we didn’t start for the biz at all…</p>
<p>But because our minds are curious about things big and small.</p>
<p>Together with others outside our field,</p>
<p>We redesign our cities, economy &amp; future; the answers no longer concealed.</p>
<p>How you say? Well that is up to you!</p>
<p>I simply hope this little poem is causative; the discussion not perdue!</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">- Architect anon.</p>

		<p>I think what I appreciate about this is that the undertone is hopeful. Like a generator. Just rumbling away quietly, trying to get others excited for the future!</p>
